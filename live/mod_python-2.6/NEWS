Oct 16 2000 -	Began a major file reorganization. All objects are now in
		separate files, and all external functions have an Mp prefix
		and named consistently with Python C API conventions.

Oct 15 2000 -	We now use mkdep.

Oct 12 2000 -   Autoconf now works. Documentation has been adjusted. Also
		added Windows installation instructions to the docs.

Oct  2 2000 -   PythonInterpPerServer is now default behavior, and this 
		directive is therefore obsolete. The old default behavior can
		be achieved via the new PythonInterpPerDirective directive.

Sep  ? 2000 -   Request is now a real python object. This means that it can be
		used to retain state between requests.

Sep  9 2000 -   Added server.register_cleanup(). This happened to be a little
		trickier than I thought since it turned out that server_rec does
		not have a pool member. Py_Finalze() has been moved to a 
		cleanup from the ChildExit handler because ChildExit runs *before*
		any cleanups. (Now I know why mod_perl doesn't use child_exit.)

Sep  8 2000 -   Sean True's fix to call note_basic_auth_failure added.

Sep  6 2000 -   Stéphane Bidoul's Win32 fixes applied.

Sep  5 2000 -   2.5 released.

Sep  4 2000 -   Added the PythonCleanupHandler.

Sep  4 2000 -   Added req.register_cleanup(). Still need server.register_cleanup(),
		as well as a PythonCleanupHandler.

Sep  2 2000 -   Added PythonInterpPerServer directive. Fixed a bug relating
		to ap_add_version_component.

Aug 28 2000 -	Added Richard Barret's patch that gives python socket module 
		behaviour from req.connection.local_addr and remote_addr.

Aug 27 2000 -   Added PythonInitHandler. Also, it looks like dynamic handler
		addition now works correctly, after trying 15 different ways of
		implementing it, resorting to req->notes seems to be the only
		option.

Aug 18 2000 -   Added req.get_remote_host()

Aug 16 2000 -   Added Dr. Timochouk's PythonOptimize directive patch.

Aug 15 2000 -   Extensive improvements to req.read() prompted by Dr. Timochouk's
		patches.

Aug 10 2000 -	Documentation change - get_basic_auth_pw must be called before
		using connection.user.

Aug 06 2000 -   Table oject now has a new method "add" which allows creation
		of multiple keys. This is useful with things like "Set-Cookie"
		headers.

Jul 22 2000 -   Added req.add_handler (dynamic handler registration)

Jul 18 2000 -   Added PythonEnablePdb
		ChildExitHandler now properly calls Py_Finalize()
		python_handler is now cumulative rather than overriding

Jul 04 2000 -   2.4.1 Released. Mostly bug fixes. Should be pretty stable.

Jun 20 2000 -   2.4 Released.

Jun 17 2000 -   Started the tutorial.html.

Jun 11 2000 -   Stephane Bidoul's thread-safe win32 changes put in. As part
		of this, all chdir()'s are gone and now instead of '.', the
		file path is prepended to pythonpath.

Jun  8 2000 -   2.3 Released.

Jun  7 2000 -	PythonImport now works.

Jun  5 2000 - 	PythonDebug and other on/off type handlers are now of type FLAG
		so they require an argument of On or Off. 

Apr    2000 - 	rename to mod_python and go apache-specific.
Nov    1998 - 	support for multiple interpreters introduced.
May    1998 - 	initial release (httpdapy).
