development of mod_python. 

Anyone who has contributed code or otherwise made contributions that
were constructive to the development of the project may have his name
listed here. Note that the decision on whether a name goes on this
list or not is initially taken by me (grisha@modpython.org) and that I 
can be wrong.  So if you feel that you should be credited as well, or
