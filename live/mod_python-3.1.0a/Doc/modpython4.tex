\section{Multiple Interpreters\label{pyapi-interps}}
      
When working with mod_python, it is important to be aware of a feature
of Python that is normally not used when using the language for
writing scripts to be run from command line. This feature is not
available from within Python itself and can only be accessed through
the \citetitle[http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/api.html]{C
language API}.

Python C API provides the ability to create \dfn{subinterpreters}. A
more detailed description of a subinterpreter is given in the
documentation for the
\citetitle[http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/initialization.html]{\cfunction{Py_NewInterpreter()}}
function. For this discussion, it will suffice to say that each
subinterpreter has its own separate namespace, not accessible from
other subinterpreters. Subinterpreters are very useful to make sure
that separate programs running under the same Apache server do not
interfere with one another.

At server start-up or mod_python initialization time, mod_python
initializes an interpreter called \dfn{main} interpreter.  The main
interpreter contains a dictionary of subinterpreters. Initially, this
dictionary is empty. With every request, as needed, subinterpreters
are created, and references to them are stored in this dictionary. The
dictionary is keyed on a string, also known as \emph{interpreter
name}. This name can be any string.  The main interpreter is named
\samp{main_interpreter}.  The way all other interpreters are named can
be controlled by \code{PythonInterp*} directives. Default behaviour is
to name interpreters using the Apache virtual server name
(\code{ServerName} directive). This means that all scripts in the same
virtual server execute in the same subinterpreter, but scripts in
different virtual servers execute in different subinterpreters with
completely separate namespaces.
\citetitle[dir-other-ipd.html]{\code{PythonInterpPerDirectory}} and
\citetitle[dir-other-ipdv.html]{\code{PythonInterpPerDirective}}
directives alter the naming convention to use the absolute path of the
directory being accessed, or the directory in which the
\code{Python*Handler} was encountered, respectively.
\citetitle[dir-other-pi.html]{\code{PythonInterpreter}} can be used to
force the interpreter name to a specific string overriding any naming
conventions.

Once created, a subinterpreter will be reused for subsequent requests.
It is never destroyed and exists until the Apache process dies.

You can find out the name of the interpreter under which you're
running by peeking at \member{req.interpreter}.

\section{Overview of a Request Handler\label{pyapi-handler}}
\indexii{request}{handler}

A \dfn{handler} is a function that processes a particular phase of a
request. Apache processes requests in phases - read the request,
process headers, provide content, etc. For every phase, it will call
handlers, provided by either the Apache core or one of its modules,
such as mod_python which passes control to functions provided by the
user and written in Python. A handler written in Python is not any
different from a handler written in C, and follows these rules:

\index{req} \indexii{request}{object} A handler function will always
be passed a reference to a request object. (Throughout this manual,
the request object is often referred to by the \code{req} variable.)

Every handler can return:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \constant{apache.OK}, meaning this phase of the request was handled by this 
  handler and no errors occurred. 

\item
  \constant{apache.DECLINED}, meaning this handler has not handled this
  phase of the request to completion and Apache needs to look for
  another handler in subsequent modules.
  
\item
  \constant{apache.\emph{HTTP_ERROR}}, meaning an HTTP error occurred. 
  \var{HTTP_ERROR} can be any of the following:

  \begin{verbatim}
    HTTP_CONTINUE                     = 100
    HTTP_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS          = 101
    HTTP_PROCESSING                   = 102
    HTTP_OK                           = 200
    HTTP_CREATED                      = 201
    HTTP_ACCEPTED                     = 202
    HTTP_NON_AUTHORITATIVE            = 203
    HTTP_NO_CONTENT                   = 204
    HTTP_RESET_CONTENT                = 205
    HTTP_PARTIAL_CONTENT              = 206
    HTTP_MULTI_STATUS                 = 207
    HTTP_MULTIPLE_CHOICES             = 300
    HTTP_MOVED_PERMANENTLY            = 301
    HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY            = 302
    HTTP_SEE_OTHER                    = 303
    HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED                 = 304
    HTTP_USE_PROXY                    = 305
    HTTP_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT           = 307
    HTTP_BAD_REQUEST                  = 400
    HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED                 = 401
    HTTP_PAYMENT_REQUIRED             = 402
    HTTP_FORBIDDEN                    = 403
    HTTP_NOT_FOUND                    = 404
    HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED           = 405
    HTTP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE               = 406
    HTTP_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED= 407
    HTTP_REQUEST_TIME_OUT             = 408
    HTTP_CONFLICT                     = 409
    HTTP_GONE                         = 410
    HTTP_LENGTH_REQUIRED              = 411
    HTTP_PRECONDITION_FAILED          = 412
    HTTP_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE     = 413
    HTTP_REQUEST_URI_TOO_LARGE        = 414
    HTTP_UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE       = 415
    HTTP_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE        = 416
    HTTP_EXPECTATION_FAILED           = 417
    HTTP_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY         = 422
    HTTP_LOCKED                       = 423
    HTTP_FAILED_DEPENDENCY            = 424
    HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR        = 500
    HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED              = 501
    HTTP_BAD_GATEWAY                  = 502
    HTTP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE          = 503
    HTTP_GATEWAY_TIME_OUT             = 504
    HTTP_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED        = 505
    HTTP_VARIANT_ALSO_VARIES          = 506
    HTTP_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE         = 507
    HTTP_NOT_EXTENDED                 = 510
  \end{verbatim}                      

\end{itemize}

As an alternative to \emph{returning} an HTTP error code, handlers can
signal an error by \emph{raising} the \constant{apache.SERVER_RETURN}
exception, and providing an HTTP error code as the exception value,
e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
raise apache.SERVER_RETURN, apache.HTTP_FORBIDDEN
\end{verbatim}

Handlers can send content to the client using the \method{req.write()}
method. 

Client data, such as POST requests, can be read by using the
\method{req.read()} function.

\begin{notice}
  The directory of the Apache \code{Python*Handler} 
  directive in effect is prepended to the \code{sys.path}. If the
  directive was specified in a server config file outside any
  \code{<Directory>}, then the directory is unknown and not prepended.
\end{notice}

An example of a minimalistic handler might be: 

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache

def requesthandler(req):
    req.content_type = "text/plain"
    req.write("Hello World!")
    return apache.OK
\end{verbatim}

\section{Overview of a Filter Handler\label{pyapi-filter}}
\indexii{filter}{handler}

A \dfn{filter handler} is a function that can alter the input or the
output of the server. There are two kinds of filters - \dfn{input} and
\dfn{output} that apply to input from the client and output to the
client respectively.

At this time mod_python supports only request-level filters, meaning
that only the body of HTTP request or response can be filtered. Apache
provides support for connection-level filters, which will be supported
in the future.

A filter handler receives a \emph{filter} object as its argument. The
request object is available as well via \code{filter.req}, but all
writing and reading should be done via the filter's object read and
write methods.

Filters need to be closed when a read operation returns None 
(indicating End-Of-Stream).

The return value of a filter is ignored. Filters cannot decline
processing like handlers, but the same effect can be achieved
by using the \method{filter.pass_on()} method.

Filters must first be registered using \code{PythonInputFilter} or
\code{PythonOutputFilter}, then added using the Apache
\code{Add/SetInputFilter} or \code{Add/SetOutputFilter} directives. 

Here is an example of how to specify an output filter, it tells the
server that all .py files should processed by CAPITALIZE filter:

\begin{verbatim}
  PythonOutputFilter capitalize CAPITALIZE
  AddOutputFilter CAPITALIZE .py
\end{verbatim}

And here is what the code for the \file{capitalize.py} might look
like:

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache
  
def outputfilter(filter):

    s = filter.read()
    while s:
        filter.write(s.upper())
	s = filter.read()

    if s is None:
        filter.close()

\end{verbatim}

When writing filters, keep in mind that a filter will be called any
time anything upstream requests an IO operation, and the filter has no
control over the amount of data passed through it and no notion of
where in the request processing it is called. For example, within a
single request, a filter may be called once or five times, and there
is no way for the filter to know beforehand that the request is over
and which of calls is last or first for this request, thought
encounter of an EOS (None returned from a read operation) is a fairly
strong indication of an end of a request.

Also note that filters may end up being called recursively in
subrequests. To avoid the data being altered more than once, always
make sure you are not in a subrequest by examining the \code{req.main}
value.

For more information on filters, see
\citetitle[http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/developer/filters.html]{http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/developer/filters.html}.

\section{Overview of a Connection Handler\label{pyapi-conn}}
\indexii{connection}{handler}

A \dfn{connection handler} handles the connection, starting almost
immediately from the point the TCP connection to the server was
made. 

Unlike HTTP handlers, connection handlers receive a \emph{connection}
object as an argument.

Connection handlers can be used to implement protocols. Here is an
example of a simple echo server:

Apache configuration:
\begin{verbatim}
  PythonConnectionHandler echo
\end{verbatim}

Contents of \filenq{echo.py} file:

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache

def connectionhandler(conn):

    while 1:
        conn.write(conn.readline())

    return apache.OK
\end{verbatim}

\section{\module{apache} -- Access to Apache Internals.}
\declaremodule[apache]{extension}{apache}
\modulesynopsis{Access to Apache Internals}
\moduleauthor{Gregory Trubetskoy}{grisha@modpython.org}

The Python interface to Apache internals is contained in a module
appropriately named \module{apache}, located inside the
\module{mod_python} package. This module provides some important
objects that map to Apache internal structures, as well as some useful
functions, all documented below. (The request object also provides an
interface to Apache internals, it is covered in its own section of
this manual.)

\indexii{_apache}{module} The \module{apache} module can only be
imported by a script running under mod_python. This is because it
depends on a built-in module \module{_apache} provided by
mod_python.

It is best imported like this:

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache
\end{verbatim}

\module{mod_python.apache} module defines the following functions and
objects. For a more in-depth look at Apache internals, see the
\citetitle[http://httpd.apache.org/dev/]{Apache Developer page}

\subsection{Functions\label{pyapi-apmeth}}

\begin{funcdesc}{log_error}{message\optional{, level, server}}
  An interface to the Apache \code{ap_log_error()}
  function. \var{message} is a string with the error message,
  \var{level} is one of the following flags constants:

  \begin{verbatim}
    APLOG_EMERG
    APLOG_ALERT
    APLOG_CRIT
    APLOG_ERR
    APLOG_WARNING
    APLOG_NOTICE
    APLOG_INFO
    APLOG_DEBUG
    APLOG_NOERRNO
  \end{verbatim}            
  
  \var{server} is a reference to a \member{req.server} object. If
  \var{server} is not specified, then the error will be logged to the
  default error log, otherwise it will be written to the error log for
  the appropriate virtual server. When \var{server} is not specified,
  the setting of LogLevel does not apply, the LogLevel is dictated by
  an httpd compile-time default, usually \code{warn}.

  If you have a reference to a request object available, consider using
  \method{req.log_error} instead, it will prepend request-specific
  information such as the source IP of the request to the log entry.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{import_module}{module_name\optional{, autoreload=1, log=0, path=None}}
  This function can be used to import modules taking advantage of
  mod_python's internal mechanism which reloads modules automatically
  if they have changed since last import. 

  \var{module_name} is a string containing the module name (it can
  contain dots, e.g. \code{mypackage.mymodule}); \var{autoreload}
  indicates whether the module should be reloaded if it has changed since
  last import; when \var{log} is true, a message will be written to
  the logs when a module is reloaded; \var{path} allows restricting
  modules to specific paths.

  Example:

  \begin{verbatim}
    from mod_python import apache
    mymodule = apache.import_module('mymodule', log=1)
  \end{verbatim}
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{allow_methods}{\optional{*args}}
  A convenience function to set values in \member{req.allowed}.
  \member{req.allowed} is a bitmask that is used to construct the
  \samp{Allow:} header. It should be set before returning a
  \code{HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED} error.

  Arguments can be one or more of the following:
  \begin{verbatim}
    M_GET
    M_PUT
    M_POST
    M_DELETE
    M_CONNECT
    M_OPTIONS
    M_TRACE
    M_PATCH
    M_PROPFIND
    M_PROPPATCH
    M_MKCOL
    M_COPY
    M_MOVE
    M_LOCK
    M_UNLOCK
    M_VERSION_CONTROL
    M_CHECKOUT
    M_UNCHECKOUT
    M_CHECKIN
    M_UPDATE
    M_LABEL
    M_REPORT
    M_MKWORKSPACE
    M_MKACTIVITY
    M_BASELINE_CONTROL
    M_MERGE
    M_INVALID
  \end{verbatim}

\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{config_tree}{}
  Returns the server-level configuration tree. This tree does not
  include directives from .htaccess files. This is a \emph{copy} of
  the tree, modifying it has no effect on the actual configuration.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{server_root}{}
  Returns the value of ServerRoot.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{make_table}{} 
  This function is obsolete and is an alias to \class{table} (see below).
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{mpm_query}{code}
  Allows querying of the MPM for various parameters such as numbers of
  processes and threads. The return value is one of three constants:
  \begin{verbatim}
AP_MPMQ_NOT_SUPPORTED      = 0  # This value specifies whether 
                                # an MPM is capable of         
                                # threading or forking.        
AP_MPMQ_STATIC             = 1  # This value specifies whether 
                                # an MPM is using a static # of
                                # threads or daemons.          
AP_MPMQ_DYNAMIC            = 2  # This value specifies whether 
                                # an MPM is using a dynamic # of
                                # threads or daemons.          
  \end{verbatim}

  The \var{code} argument must be one of the following:
  \begin{verbatim}
AP_MPMQ_MAX_DAEMON_USED    = 1  # Max # of daemons used so far 
AP_MPMQ_IS_THREADED        = 2  # MPM can do threading         
AP_MPMQ_IS_FORKED          = 3  # MPM can do forking           
AP_MPMQ_HARD_LIMIT_DAEMONS = 4  # The compiled max # daemons   
AP_MPMQ_HARD_LIMIT_THREADS = 5  # The compiled max # threads   
AP_MPMQ_MAX_THREADS        = 6  # # of threads/child by config 
AP_MPMQ_MIN_SPARE_DAEMONS  = 7  # Min # of spare daemons       
AP_MPMQ_MIN_SPARE_THREADS  = 8  # Min # of spare threads       
AP_MPMQ_MAX_SPARE_DAEMONS  = 9  # Max # of spare daemons       
AP_MPMQ_MAX_SPARE_THREADS  = 10 # Max # of spare threads       
AP_MPMQ_MAX_REQUESTS_DAEMON= 11 # Max # of requests per daemon 
AP_MPMQ_MAX_DAEMONS        = 12 # Max # of daemons by config   
  \end{verbatim}

Example:
  \begin{verbatim}
if apache.mpm_query(apache.AP_MPMQ_IS_THREADED):
    # do something
else:
    # do something else
  \end{verbatim}
\end{funcdesc}

\subsection{Table Object (mp_table)\obindex{table}\label{pyapi-mptable}}

\index{table}
\begin{classdesc}{table}{\optional{mapping-or-sequence}}
  Returns a new empty object of type \code{mp_table}. See Section
  \ref{pyapi-mptable} for description of the table object. The
  \var{mapping-or-sequence} will be used to provide initial values for
  the table.  

  The table object is a wrapper around the Apache APR table. The table
  object behaves very much like a dictionary (including the Python 2.2
  features such as support of the \code{in} operator, etc.), with the 
  following differences:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Both keys and values must be strings.
  \item
    Key lookups are case-insensitive.
  \item
    Duplicate keys are allowed (see \method{add()} below). When there is
    more than one value for a key, a subscript operation returns a list.
  \end{itemize}

  Much of the information that Apache uses is stored in tables. For
  example, \member{req.headers_in} and \member{req.headers_out}.

  All the tables that mod_python provides inside the request
  object are actual mappings to the Apache structures, so changing the
  Python table also changes the underlying Apache table.

  In addition to normal dictionary-like behavior, the table object also
  has the following method:

  \begin{methoddesc}[table]{add}{key, val}
    \function{add()} allows for creating duplicate keys, which is useful 
    when multiple headers, such as \code{Set-Cookie:} are required.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \versionadded{3.0}
\end{classdesc}

\subsection{Request Object\index{request}\label{pyapi-mprequest}}

The request object is a Python mapping to the Apache
\code{request_rec} structure. When a handler is invoked, it is always
passed a single argument - the request object. 

You can dynamically assign attributes to it as a way to communicate
between handlers.

\subsubsection{Request Methods\label{pyapi-mprequest-meth}}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{add_common_vars}{}
  Calls the Apache \cfunction{ap_add_common_vars()} function. After a
  call to this method, \member{req.subprocess_env} will contain a
  lot of CGI information.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{add_handler}{htype, handler\optional{, dir}}

  Allows dynamic handler registration. \var{htype} is a string
  containing the name of any of the apache request (but not filter or
  connection) handler directives,
  e.g. \samp{PythonHandler}. \var{handler} is a string containing the
  name of the module and the handler function.  Optional \var{dir} is
  a string containing the name of the directory to be added to the
  pythonpath. If no directory is specified, then, if there is already
  a handler of the same type specified, its directory is inherited,
  otherwise the directory of the presently executing handler is used.
  
  A handler added this way only persists throughout the life of the
  request. It is possible to register more handlers while inside the
  handler of the same type. One has to be careful as to not to create
  an infinite loop this way.

  Dynamic handler registration is a useful technique that allows the
  code to dynamically decide what will happen next. A typical example
  might be a \code{PythonAuthenHandler} that will assign different
  \code{PythonHandlers} based on the authorization level, something
  like:

  \begin{verbatim}
if manager:
    req.add_handler("PythonHandler", "menu::admin")
else:
    req.add_handler("PythonHandler", "menu::basic")
  \end{verbatim}                              

  \begin{notice}
    There is no checking being done on the validity of the handler
    name. If you pass this function an invalid handler it will simply be
    ignored.
  \end{notice}
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{allow_methods}{methods\optional{, reset}}
  Adds methods to the \member{req.allowed_methods} list. This list
  will be passed in \code{Allowed:} header if
  \constant{HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED} or \constant{HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED}
  is returned to the client. Note that Apache doesn't do anything to
  restrict the methods, this list is only used to construct the
  header. The actual method-restricting logic has to be provided in the
  handler code.

  \var{methods} is a sequence of strings. If \var{reset} is 1, then
  the list of methods is first cleared.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{document_root}{}
  Returns DocumentRoot setting.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_basic_auth_pw}{}
  Returns a string containing the password when Basic authentication is
  used.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_config}{}
  Returns a reference to the table object containing the mod_python
  configuration in effect for this request except for
  \code{Python*Handler} and \code{PythonOption} (The latter can be
  obtained via \method{req.get_options()}. The table has directives as
  keys, and their values, if any, as values.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_remote_host}{\optional{type, str_is_ip}}

  This method is used to determine remote client's DNS name or IP
  number. The first call to this function may entail a DNS look up, but
  subsequent calls will use the cached result from the first call.

  The optional \var{type} argument can specify the following: 

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    \code{apache.REMOTE_HOST} Look up the DNS name. Return None if Apache
    directive \code{HostNameLookups} is \code{off} or the hostname cannot
    be determined.

  \item                  
    \code{apache.REMOTE_NAME} \emph{(Default)} Return the DNS name if
    possible, or the IP (as a string in dotted decimal notation)
    otherwise.

  \item
    \code{apache.REMOTE_NOLOOKUP} Don't perform a DNS lookup, return an
    IP. Note: if a lookup was performed prior to this call, then the
    cached host name is returned.

  \item
    \code{apache.REMOTE_DOUBLE_REV} Force a double-reverse lookup. On 
    failure, return None.

  \end{itemize}

  If \var{str_is_ip} is \code{None} or unspecified, then the return
  value is a string representing the DNS name or IP address.

  If the optional \var{str_is_ip} argument is not \code{None}, then the
  return value is an \code{(address, str_is_ip)} tuple, where \var{str_is_ip}
  is non-zero if \code{address} is an IP address string.

  On failure, \code{None} is returned.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{get_options}{}
  Returns a reference to the table object containing the options set by
  the \code{PythonOption} directives.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{internal_redirect}{new_uri}
  Internally redirects the request to the \var{new_uri}. \var{new_uri}
  must be a string.

  The httpd server handles internal redirection by creating a new
  request object and processing all request phases. Within an internal
  redirect, \code{req.prev} will contain a reference to a request
  object from which it was redirected.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}{log_error}{message\optional{, level}}
  An interface to the Apache \code{ap_log_rerror}
  function. \var{message} is a string with the error message,
  \var{level} is one of the following flags constants:

  \begin{verbatim}
    APLOG_EMERG
    APLOG_ALERT
    APLOG_CRIT
    APLOG_ERR
    APLOG_WARNING
    APLOG_NOTICE
    APLOG_INFO
    APLOG_DEBUG
    APLOG_NOERRNO
  \end{verbatim}            

  If you need to write to log and do not have a reference to a request object,
  use the \function{apache.log_error} function.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{read}{\optional{len}}

  Reads at most \var{len} bytes directly from the client, returning a
  string with the data read. If the \var{len} argument is negative or
  omitted, reads all data given by the client.

  This function is affected by the \code{Timeout} Apache configuration
  directive. The read will be aborted and an \exception{IOError}
  raised if the \code{Timeout} is reached while reading client data.

  This function relies on the client providing the \code{Content-length}
  header. Absence of the \code{Content-length} header will be treated as
  if \code{Content-length: 0} was supplied.

  Incorrect \code{Content-length} may cause the function to try to read
  more data than available, which will make the function block until a
  \code{Timeout} is reached.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{readline}{\optional{len}}
  Like \function{read()} but reads until end of line. 
  
  \begin{notice}
    In accordance with the HTTP specification, most clients will
    be terminating lines with \samp{\e r\e n} rather
    than simply \samp{\e n}.
  \end{notice}

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{readlines}{\optional{sizehint}}
  Reads all or up to \var{sizehint} bytes of lines using
  \method{readline} and returns a list of the lines read.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{register_cleanup}{callable\optional{, data}}

  Registers a cleanup. Argument \var{callable} can be any callable
  object, the optional argument \var{data} can be any object (default is
  \code{None}). At the very end of the request, just before the actual
  request record is destroyed by Apache, \var{callable} will be called
  with one argument, \var{data}.

  It is OK to pass the request object as data, but keep in mind that
  when the cleanup is executed, the request processing is already
  complete, so doing things like writing to the client is completely
  pointless. 

  If errors are encountered during cleanup processing, they should be in
  error log, but otherwise will not affect request processing in any
  way, which makes cleanup bugs sometimes hard to spot.

  If the server is shut down before the cleanup had a chance to run,
  it's possible that it will not be executed.

\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{sendfile}{path\optional{, offset, len}}
  Sends \var{len} bytes of file \var{path} directly to the client,
  starting at offset \var{offset} using the server's internal
  API. \var{offset} defaults to 0, and \var{len} defaults to -1 (send
  the entire file). 

  This function provides the most efficient way to send a file to the
  client.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{write}{string}
  Writes \var{string} directly to the client, then flushes the buffer. 
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[request]{set_content_length}{len}
  Sets the value of \member{req.clength} and the \samp{Content-Length}
  header to len. Note that after the headers have been sent out (which
  happens just before the first byte of the body is written,
  i.e. first call to \member{req.write()}), calling the method is
  meaningless.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{memberdesc}[request]{content_type}
  String. The content type. Mod_python maintains an internal flag
  (\member{req._content_type_set}) to keep track of whether

\section{\module{util} -- Miscellaneous Utilities\label{pyapi-util}}
\declaremodule[util]{extension}{util}
\modulesynopsis{Miscellaneous Utilities}
\moduleauthor{Gregory Trubetskoy}{grisha@modpython.org}

The \module{util} module provides a number of utilities handy to a web
application developer similar to those in the standard library
\module{cgi} module. The implementations in the \module{util} module
are much more efficient because they call directly into Apache API's
as opposed to using CGI which relies on the environment to pass
information.

The recommended way of using this module is:
\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import util
\end{verbatim}

\begin{seealso}
  \seetitle[http://CGI-Spec.Golux.Com/]
	   {Common Gateway Interface RFC Project Page}
	   {for detailed information on the CGI specification}
\end{seealso}

\subsection{FieldStorage class\label{pyapi-util-fstor}}

Access to form data is provided via the \class{FieldStorage}
class. This class is similar to the standard library module
\module{cgi} \class{FieldStorage}.

\begin{classdesc}{FieldStorage}{req\optional{, keep_blank_values, strict_parsing}}
  This class provides uniform access to HTML form data submitted by the
  client.  \var{req} is an instance of the mod_python request object.

  The optional argument \var{keep_blank_values} is a flag indicating
  whether blank values in URL encoded form data should be treated as
  blank strings. The default is false, which means that blank values are
  ignored as if they were not included.

  The optional argument \var{strict_parsing} is not yet implemented.

  During initialization, \class{FieldStorage} class reads all of the
  data provided by the client. Since all data provided by the client is
  consumed at this point, there should be no more than one
  \class{FieldStorage} class instantiated per single request, nor should
  you make any attempts to read client data before or after
  instantiating a \class{FieldStorage}.

  The data read from the client is then parsed into separate fields and
  packaged in \class{Field} objects, one per field. For HTML form inputs
  of type \code{file}, a temporary file is created that can later be
  accessed via the \member{file} attribute of a \class{Field} object.

  The \class{FieldStorage} class has a mapping object interface, i.e. it
  can be treated like a dictionary. When used as a mapping, the keys are
  form input names, and the returned dictionary value can be:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    An instance of \class{StringField}, containing the form input
    value. This is only when there is a single value corresponding to the
    input name. \class{StringField} is a subclass of \class{str} which
    provides the additional \member{value} attribute for compatibility
    with standard library \module{cgi} module.
  \item
    An instances of a \class{Field} class, if the input is a file upload.
  \item
    A list of \class{StringField} and/or \class{Field} objects. This is
    when multiple values exist, such as for a \code{<select>} HTML form
    element.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{notice}
    Unlike the standard library \module{cgi} module
    \class{FieldStorage} class, a \class{Field} object is returned
    \emph{only} when it is a file upload. In all other cases an instance
    the return is an instance of \class{StringField}, which is a subclass
    of \class{str}. This means that you do not need to use the
    \member{.value} attribute to access values of fields in most cases.
  \end{notice}

  In addition to standard mapping object methods, \class{FieldStorage} objects
  have the following attributes:

  \begin{memberdesc}{list}
    This is a list of \class{Field} objects, one for each input. Multiple
    inputs with the same name will have multiple elements in this list.
  \end{memberdesc}

\end{classdesc}

\subsection{Field class\label{pyapi-util-fstor-fld}}

\begin{classdesc}{Field}{}
  This class is used internally by \class{FieldStorage} and is not
  meant to be instantiated by the user. Each instance of a \class{Field}
  class represents an HTML Form input.

  \class{Field} instances have the following attributes:

  \begin{memberdesc}{name}
    The input name.
  \end{memberdesc}

  \begin{memberdesc}{value}
    The input value. This attribute can be used to read data from a file
    upload as well, but one has to exercise caution when dealing with
    large files since when accessed via \member{value}, the whole file is
    read into memory.
  \end{memberdesc}

  \begin{memberdesc}{file}
    This is a file object. For file uploads it points to a temporary file.
    For simple values, it is a \class{StringIO} object, so you can read
    simple string values via this attribute instead of using the \member{value}
    attribute as well.
  \end{memberdesc}

  \begin{memberdesc}{filename}
    The name of the file as provided by the client.
  \end{memberdesc}

  \begin{memberdesc}{type}
    The content-type for this input as provided by the client.
  \end{memberdesc}

  \begin{memberdesc}{type_options}
    This is what follows the actual content type in the \code{content-type}
    header provided by the client, if anything. This is a dictionary.
  \end{memberdesc}

  \begin{memberdesc}{disposition}
    The value of the first part of the \code{content-disposition} header.
  \end{memberdesc}

  \begin{memberdesc}{disposition_options}
    The second part (if any) of the \code{content-disposition} header in
    the form of a dictionary.
  \end{memberdesc}

\subsection{Other functions\label{pyapi-util-funcs}}

\begin{funcdesc}{parse_qs}{qs\optional{, keep_blank_values, strict_parsing}}

  This function is functionally equivalent to the standard library
  \module{cgi} \function{parse_qs}, except that it is written in C and is
  much faster. 

  Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type
  \mimetype{application/x-www-form-urlencoded}).  Data are
  returned as a dictionary.  The dictionary keys are the unique query
  variable names and the values are lists of values for each name.

  The optional argument \var{keep_blank_values} is a flag indicating
  whether blank values in URL encoded queries should be treated as blank
  strings.  A true value indicates that blanks should be retained as
  blank strings.  The default false value indicates that blank values
  are to be ignored and treated as if they were not included.

  \begin{notice}
    The \var{strict_parsing} argument is not yet implemented.
  \end{notice}

\end{funcdesc}


\begin{funcdesc}{parse_qsl}{qs\optional{, keep_blank_values, strict_parsing}}

  This function is functionally equivalent to the standard library
  \module{cgi} \function{parse_qsl}, except that it is written in C and is
  much faster. 

  Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type
  \mimetype{application/x-www-form-urlencoded}).  Data are
  returned as a list of name, value pairs.

  The optional argument \var{keep_blank_values} is a flag indicating
  whether blank values in URL encoded queries should be treated as blank
  strings.  A true value indicates that blanks should be retained as
  blank strings.  The default false value indicates that blank values
  are to be ignored and treated as if they were not included.

  \begin{notice}
    The \var{strict_parsing} argument is not yet implemented.
  \end{notice}

\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{redirect}{req, location\optional{, permanent=0, text=None}}
  This is a convenience function to redirect the browser to another
  location. When \var{permanent} is true, \constant{MOVED_PERMANENTLY}
  status is sent to the client, otherwise it is
  \constant{MOVED_TEMPORARILY}. A short text is sent to the browser
  informing that the document has moved (for those rare browsers that
  do not support redirection); this text can be overridden by
  supplying a \var{text} string.

  If this function is called after the headers have already been sent,
  an \exception{IOError} is raised.

  This function raises \exception{apache.SERVER_RETURN} exception to
  abandon any further processing of the handle. If you do not want
  this, you can wrap the call to \function{redirect} in a try/except
  block catching the \exception{apache.SERVER_RETURN}.

\section{\module{Cookie} -- HTTP State Management\label{pyapi-cookie}}
\declaremodule[Cookie]{extension}{Cookie}
\modulesynopsis{HTTP State Management}
\moduleauthor{Gregory Trubetskoy}{grisha@modpython.org}

The \module{Cookie} module provides convenient ways for creating,
parsing, sending and receiving HTTP Cookies, as defined in the
specification published by Netscape.

\begin{notice}
  Even though there are official IETF RFC's describing HTTP State
  Management Mechanism using cookies, the de facto standard supported
  by most browsers is the original Netscape specification.
  Furthermore, true compliance with IETF standards is actually
  incompatible with many popular browsers, even those that claim to be
  RFC-compliant.  Therefore, this module supports the current common
  practice, and is not fully RFC compliant.
\end{notice}

\end{seealso}

\subsection{Classes\label{pyapi-cookie-classes}}

\begin{classdesc}{Cookie}{name, value\optional{, attributes}}

  This class is used to construct a single cookie named \var{name}
  and having \var{value} as the value. Additionally, any of the 
  attributes defined in the Netscape specification and RFC2109 can by
  supplied as keyword arguments.

  The attributes of the class represent cookie attributes, and their
  string representations become part of the string representation of
  the cookie. The \class{Cookie} class restricts attribute names to
  only valid values, specifically, only the following attributes are
  allowed: \code{name, value, version, path, domain, secure, comment,
  expires, max_age, commentURL, discard, port, __data__}.

  The \code{__data__} attribute is a general-purpose dictionary that
  can be used for storing arbitrary values, when necessary (This is
  useful when subclassing \class{Cookie}).

  The \member{expires} attribute is a property whose value is checked
  upon setting to be in format \samp{Wdy, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT}
  (as dictated per Netscape cookie specification), or a numeric value
  representing time in seconds since beginning of epoch (which will be
  automatically correctly converted to GMT time string). An invalid
  \code{expires} value will raise \exception{ValueError}.

  When converted to a string, a \class{Cookie} will be in correct
  format usable as value in a \samp{Cookie} or \samp{Set-Cookie}
  header.

  \begin{notice}
    Unlike the Python Standard Library Cookie classes, this
    class represents a single cookie (referred to as \dfn{Morsel} in
    Python Standard Library).
  \end{notice}

  \begin{methoddesc}[Cookie]{parse}{string}
    This is a class method that can be used to create a \class{Cookie}
    instance from a cookie string \var{string} as passed in a header
    value. During parsing, attribute names are converted to lower
    case.

    Because this is a class method, it must be called explicitly
    specifying the class.

    This method returns a dictionary of \class{Cookie} instances, not
    a single \class{Cookie} instance.

    Here is an example of getting a single \class{Cookie} instance:
    \begin{verbatim}
mycookies = Cookie.parse("spam=eggs; expires=Sat, 14-Jun-2003 02:42:36 GMT")
spamcookie = mycookies["spam"]
    \end{verbatim}

    \begin{notice}
      Because this method uses a dictionary, it is not possible to
      have duplicate cookies. If you would like to have more than one
      value in a single cookie, consider using a \class{MarshalCookie}.
    \end{notice}

  \end{methoddesc}

\end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{SignedCookie}{name, value, secret\optional{, attributes}}

  This is a subclass of \class{Cookie}. This class creates cookies
  whose name and value are automatically signed using HMAC (md5) with
  a provided secret \var{secret}, which must be a non-empty string.

  \begin{methoddesc}[SignedCookie]{parse}{string, secret}
    This method acts the same way as \class{Cookie.parse()}, but also
    verifies that the cookie is correctly signed. If the signature
    cannot be verified, the object returned will be of class
    \class{Cookie}.

    \begin{notice}
      Always check the types of objects returned by
      \method{SignedCookie.parse()}.If it is an instance of
      \class{Cookie} (as opposed to \class{SignedCookie}), the
      signature verification has failed:
      \begin{verbatim}
# assume spam is supposed to be a signed cookie
if type(spam) is not Cookie.SignedCookie:
    # do something that indicates cookie isn't signed correctly
      \end{verbatim}
    \end{notice}
  \end{methoddesc}

\end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{MarshalCookie}{name, value, secret\optional{, attributes}}

  This is a subclass of \class{SignedCookie}. It allows for
  \var{value} to be any marshallable objects. Core Python types such as
  string, integer, list, etc. are all marshallable object. For a
  complete list see
  \citetitle[http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-marshal.html]{marshal}
  module documentation.

  When parsing, the signature is checked first, so incorrectly signed cookies
  will not be unmarshalled.

\end{classdesc}

\subsection{Functions\label{pyapi-cookie-func}}

\begin{funcdesc}{add_cookie}{req, cookie\optional{, value, attributes}}
  This is a convenience function for setting a cookie in request
  headers. \var{req} is a mod_python \class{Request} object.  If
  \var{cookie} is an instance of \class{Cookie} (or subclass thereof),
  then the cookie is set, otherwise, \var{cookie} must be a string, in
  which case a \class{Cookie} is constructed using \var{cookie} as
  name, \var{value} as the value, along with any valid \class{Cookie}
  attributes specified as keyword arguments.

  This function will also set \samp{Cache-Control:
  no-cache="set-cookie"} header to inform caches that the cookie value
  should not be cached.

  Here is one way to use this function:
  \begin{verbatim}
c = Cookie.Cookie('spam', 'eggs', expires=time.time()+300)
Cookie.add_cookie(req, c)
  \end{verbatim}
  Here is another:
  \begin{verbatim}
Cookie.add_cookie(req, 'spam', 'eggs', expires=time.time()+300)
  \end{verbatim}
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{get_cookies}{req \optional{, Class, data}}
  This is a convenience function for retrieving cookies from incoming
  headers. \var{req} is a mod_python \class{Request}
  object. \var{Class} is a class whose \method{parse()} method will be
  used to parse the cookies, it defaults to \code{Cookie}. \var{Data}
  can be any number of keyword arguments which, will be passed to
  \method{parse()} (This is useful for \class{signedCookie} and
  \class{MarshalCookie} which require \code{secret} as an additional
  argument to \method{parse}).
\end{funcdesc}

\subsection{Examples\label{pyapi-cookie-example}}

This example sets a simple cookie which expires in 300 seconds:

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import Cookie, apache
import time

def handler(req):

    cookie = Cookie.Cookie('eggs', 'spam')
    cookie.expires = time.time() + 300
    Cookie.add_cookie(req, cookie)

    req.write('This response contains a cookie!\n')
    return apache.OK

\end{verbatim}

This example checks for incoming marshal cookie and displays it to the
client. If no incoming cookie is present a new marshal cookie is set.
This example uses \samp{secret007} as the secret for HMAC signature.

\begin{verbatim}
from mod_python import apache, Cookie

def handler(req):
    
    cookies = Cookie.get_cookie(req, Cookie.MarshalCookie,
                                    secret='secret007')
    if cookies.has_key('spam'):
        spamcookie = cookies['spam']

        req.write('Great, a spam cookie was found: %s\n' \
                                      % str(spamcookie))
        if type(spamcookie) is Cookie.MarshalCookie:
            req.write('Here is what it looks like decoded: %s=%s\n'
                      % (spamcookie.name, spamcookie.value))
	else:
            req.write('WARNING: The cookie found is not a \
                       MarshalCookie, it may have been tapered with!')

    else:

        # MarshaCookie allows value to be any marshallable object
        value = {'egg_count': 32, 'color': 'white'}
        Cookie.add_cookie(req, Cookie.MarshalCookie('spam', value, \
                          'secret007'))
        req.write('Spam cookie not found, but we just set one!\n')

    return apache.OK
\end{verbatim}

\section{\module{Session} -- Session Management\label{pyapi-sess}}
\declaremodule[Session]{extension}{Session}
\modulesynopsis{Session Management}
\moduleauthor{Gregory Trubetskoy}{grisha@modpython.org}

The \module{Session} module provides objects for maintaining persistent
sessions across requests.

The module contains a \class{BaseSession} class, which is not meant to
be used directly (it provides no means of storing a session), and a
\class{DbmSession} class, which uses a dbm to store sessions. 

The \class{BaseSession} class also provides session locking, both
across processes and threads. For locking it uses APR global_mutexes
(a number of them is pre-created at startup) The mutex number is
computed by using modulus of the session id
\function{hash()}. (Therefore it's possible that different session
id's will have the same hash, but the only implication is that those
two sessions cannot be locked at the same time resulting in a slight
delay.)

\subsection{Classes\label{pyapi-sess-classes}}

\begin{funcdesc}{Session}{req\optional{, sid, secret, timeout, lock, lockfile}}
  This function queries the MPM and based on that returns either a new
  instance of \class{DbmSession} or \class{MemorySession}. It takes
  same arguments as \class{BaseSession}.

  \class{MemorySession} will be used if the MPM is threaded and not
  forked (such is the case on Windows), or if it threaded, forked, but
  only one process is allowed (the worker MPM can be configured to run
  this way). In all other cases \class{DbmSession} is used.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{BaseSession}{req\optional{, sid, secret, timeout, lock, lockfile}}

  This class is meant to be used as a base class for other classes
  that implement a session storage mechanism. \var{req} is a required
  reference to a mod_python request object.

  \class{BaseSession} is a subclass of \class{dict}. Data can be
  stored and retrieved from the session by using it as a
  dictionary. 

  \var{sid} is an optional session id; if provided, such a session
  must already exist, otherwise it is ignored and a new session with a
  new sid is created. If \var{sid} is not provided, the object will
  attempt to look at cookies for session id. If a sid is found in
  cookies, but it is not previously known or the session has expired,
  then a new sid is created. Whether a session is ``new'' can be
  determined by calling the \method{is_new()} method.

  Cookies generated by sessions will have a path attribute which is
  calculated by comparing the server \code{DocumentRoot} and the
  directory in which the \code{PythonHandler} directive currently in
  effect was specified. E.g. if document root is \file{/a/b/c} and
  \code{PythonHandler} was specified in \file{/a/b/c/d/e}, the path
  will be set to \file{/d/e}. You can force a specific path by using
  \code{ApplicationPath} option (\samp{PythonOption ApplicationPath
  /my/path} in server configuration).

  When a \var{secret} is provided, \class{BaseSession} will use
  \class{SignedCookie} when generating cookies thereby making the
  session id almost impossible to fake. The default is to use plain
  \class{Cookie} (though even if not signed, the session id is
  generated to be very difficult to guess).

  A session will timeout if it has not been accessed for more than
  \var{timeout}, which defaults to 30 minutes. An attempt to load an
  expired session will result in a ``new'' session.

  The \var{lock} argument (defaults to 1) indicates whether locking
  should be used. When locking is on, only one session object with a
  particular session id can be instantiated at a time. \var{lockfile}
  is the name of a file to be used for inter-process locks.

  A session is in ``new'' state when the session id was just
  generated, as opposed to being passed in via cookies or the
  \var{sid} argument.


  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{is_new}{}
    Returns 1 if this session is new. A session will also be ``new''
    after an attempt to instantiate an expired or non-existent
    session. It is important to use this method to test whether an
    attempt to instantiate a session has succeeded, e.g.:
    \begin{verbatim}
sess = Session(req)
if sess.is_new():
    # redirect to login
    util.redirect(req, 'http://www.mysite.com/login')
    \end{verbatim}
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{id}{}
    Returns the session id.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{created}{}
    Returns the session creation time in seconds since beginning of
    epoch.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{last_accessed}{}
    Returns last access time in seconds since beginning of epoch.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{timeout}{}
    Returns session timeout interval in seconds.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{set_timeout}{secs}
    Set timeout to \var{secs}.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{invalidate}{}
    This method will remove the session from the persistent store and
    also place a header in outgoing headers to invalidate the session
    id cookie.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{load}{}
    Load the session values from storage.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{save}{}
    This method writes session values to storage.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{delete}{}
    Remove the session from storage.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{init_lock}{}
    This method initializes the session lock. There is no need to ever
    call this method, it is intended for subclasses that wish to use
    an alternative locking mechanism.
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{lock}{}
    Locks this session. If the session is already locked by another
    thread/process, wait until that lock is released. There is no need
    to call this method if locking is handled automatically (default).
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{unlock}{}
    Unlocks this session. (Same as \method{lock()} - when locking is
    handled automatically (default), there is no need to call this
    method).
  \end{methoddesc}

  \begin{methoddesc}[BaseSession]{cleanup}{}
    This method is for subclasses to implement session storage
    cleaning mechanism (i.e. deleting expired sessions, etc.). It will
    be called at random, the chance of it being called is controlled
    by \constant{CLEANUP_CHANCE} \module{Session} module variable
    (default 1000). This means that cleanups will be ordered at random
    and there is 1 in 1000 chance of it happening. Subclasses
    implementing this method should not perform the (potentially time
    consuming) cleanup operation in this method, but should instead
    use \method{req.register_cleanup} to register a cleanup which will
    be executed after the request has been processed.
  \end{methoddesc}

\end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{MemorySession}{req, \optional{, sid, secret, dbmtype, timeout}}

  This class provides session storage using a global dictionary. This
  class provides by far the best performance, but cannot be used in a
  multi-process configuration, and also consumes memory for every
  active session.

\end{classdesc}

\begin{classdesc}{DbmSession}{req, \optional{, dbm, sid, secret, dbmtype, timeout}}

  This class provides session storage using a dbm file. Generally, dbm
  access is very fast, and most dbm implementations memory-map files
  for faster access, which makes their performance nearly as fast as
  direct shared memory access.

  \var{dbm} is the name of the dbm file (the file must be writable by
  the httpd process). This file is not deleted when the server process
  is stopped (a nice side benefit of this is that sessions can survive
  server restarts). By default the session information is stored in a
  dbmfile named \file{mp_sess.dbm} and stored in a temporary directory
  returned by \code{tempfile.gettempdir()} standard library
  function. It can be overridden by setting \code{PythonOption
  SessionDbm filename}.

  The implementation uses Python \module{anydbm} module, which will
  default to \module{dbhash} on most systems. If you need to use a
  specific dbm implementation (e.g. \module{gdbm}), you can pass that
  module as \var{dbmtype}.

\end{classdesc}

\section{\module{_psp} -- Python Server Pages\label{pyapi-psp}}
\declaremodule[psp]{extension}{_psp}
\modulesynopsis{Python Server Pages}
\moduleauthor{Gregory Trubetskoy}{grisha@modpython.org}

The \module{_psp} module provides a way to convert text documents
(including, but not limited to HTML documents) containing Python code
embedded in special brackets into pure Python code suitable for
execution within a mod_python handler, thereby providing a versatile
mechanism for delivering dynamic content in a style similar to similar
to ASP, JSP and others.

The parser used by \module{_psp} is written in C (generated using flex)
and is therefore very fast.

Unlike other mod_python modules, \module{_psp} is written in such a way
that it can be imported outside of the Apache httpd process, e.g. in
stand-alone command-line programs.

\emph{See \ref{hand-psp} ``PSP Handler'' for additional PSP
information.}

\subsection{PSP Syntax\label{pyapi-psp-syntax}}

Inside the document, Python \dfn{code} needs to be surrounded by
\samp{<\%} and \samp{\%>}. Python \dfn{expressions} are enclosed in
\samp{<\%=} and \samp{\%>}. A \dfn{directive} can be enclosed in
\samp{<\%@} and \samp{\%>}. A comment (which will never be part of
the resulting code) can be enclosed in \samp{<\%--} and \samp{--\%>}

Here is a primitive PSP page that demonstrated use of both code and
expression embedded in an HTML document:

\begin{verbatim}
  <html>
  <%
  import time
  %>
  Hello world, the time is: <%=time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d, %H:%M:%S")%>
  </html>
\end{verbatim}

Internally, the PSP parser would translate the above page into the
following Python code:

\begin{verbatim}
  req.write("""<html>
  """)
  import time
  req.write("""
  Hello world, the time is: """); req.write(str(time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d, %H:%M:%S"))); req.write("""
  </html>
  """)
\end{verbatim}

This code, when executed inside a handler would result in a page
displaying words \samp{Hello world, the time is: } followed by current time.

Python code can be used to output parts of the page conditionally or
in loops. Blocks are denoted from within Python code by
indentation. The last indentation in Python code (even if it is a
comment) will persist through the document until either end of
document or more Python code.

Here is an example:
\begin{verbatim}
  <html>
  <%
  for n in range(3):
      # This indent will persist
  %>
  <p>This paragraph will be 
  repeated 3 times.</p>
  <%
  # This line will cause the block to end
  %>
  This line will only be shown once.<br>
  </html>
\end{verbatim}

The above will be internally translated to the following Python code:

\begin{verbatim}
  req.write("""<html>
  """)
  for n in range(3):
      # This indent will persist
      req.write("""
  <p>This paragraph will be
  repeated 3 times.</p>
  """)
  # This line will cause the block to end
  req.write("""
  This line will only be shown once.<br>
  </html>
  """)
\end{verbatim}

The parser is also smart enough to figure out the indent if the last
line of Python ends with \samp{:} (colon). Considering this, and that the
indent is reset when a newline is encountered inside \samp{<\% \%>}, the
above page can be written as:

\begin{verbatim}
  <html>
  <%
  for n in range(3):
  %>
  <p>This paragraph will be 
  repeated 3 times.</p>
  <%
  %>
  This line will only be shown once.<br>
  </html>
\end{verbatim}

However, the above code can be confusing, thus having descriptive
comments denoting blocks is highly recommended as a good practice.

The only directive supported at this time is \code{include}, here is
how it can be used:

\begin{verbatim}
<%@ include file="/file/to/include"%>
\end{verbatim}

If the \function{parse()} function was called with the \var{dir}
argument, then the file can be specified as a relative path, otherwise

\begin{funcdesc}{parse}{filename\optional{, dir}}

  This function will open file named \var{filename}, read and parse its
  content and return a string of resulting Python code.

  If \var{dir} is specified, then the ultimate filename to be parsed
  is constructed by concatenating \var{dir} and \var{filename}, and
  the argument to \code{include} directive can be specified as a
  relative path. (Note that this is a simple concatenation, no path
  separator will be inserted if \var{dir} does not end with one).
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{parsestring}{string}

  This function will parse contents of \var{string} and return a string
  of resulting Python code.

\end{funcdesc}
