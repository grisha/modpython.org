      <a name="prerequisites"><h2>0. Prerequisites</h2></a>

      <ul>
	<li> Python 1.5.2
	<li> Apache 1.3
      </ul>
      
      You will need to have the include files for both Apache and
      Python, as well as the Python library installed on your
      system. If you installed Python and Apache from source, then you
      have nothing to worry about. However, if you are using
      prepackaged software (e.g. Linux Red Hat RPM, Debian, or
      Solaris packages from sunsite, etc) then chances are, you just
      have the binaries and not the sources on your system. Often, the
      include files and the libraries are part of separate
      "development" package. If you are not sure if you have all the
      necessary files, either compile and install Python and Apache
      from source, or refer to the documentation for your system on
      how to get the development packages.

      <a name="python"><h2>1. Installing Python Libraries</h2></a>

      <ul>
	<li> Unzip and untar the distribution file into some directory
	  (xxx is the version number): 
	  <pre>
    $ gunzip mod_python-xxx.tgz
    $ tar xzvf mod_python-xxx.tar
	  </pre>
	  
	<li>Copy the directory lib/python/mod_python to some place in 
	  your PYTHONPATH, usually /usr/local/lib/python1.5/site-python 
	  (this step will require root access):
	  <pre>
      $ su
      # cp -r mod_python-xxx/lib/python/mod_python /usr/local/lib/python-1.5/site-packages/
	  </pre>
	<li>Compile the modules in the mod_python package (still as root):
	  <pre>
      # python /usr/local/lib/python1.5/compileall.py /usr/local/lib/python1.5/site-packages/mod_python
	  </pre>
      </ul>

      <a name="compiling"><h2>2. Compiling</h2></a>
      
      There are two ways that this module can be compiled and linked to Apache -
      statically, or as a Dynamic Shared Object. 
      <p>
	Static linking is a more &quot;traditional&quot; approach, and
	most programmers prefer it for its simplicity. The drawback is
	that it entails recompiling Apache, which some people cannot
	do for a variety of reasons. For example in a shared web
	hosting environment the Apache binary might not be writable by
	the user.
      <p>
	Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) is a newer and still somewhat experimental
	approach. The module gets compiled as a library that is dynamically
	loaded by the server at run time. A more detailed description of the
	Apache DSO mechanism is available 
	<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/dso.html">here</a>.
      <p>
	The advantage is that a module can be installed without
	recompiling Apache and used as needed. DSO has its
	disadvantages, however. Compiling a module like mod_python
	into a DSO can be a complicated process because Python, depending
	on configuration, may rely on a number of other libraries, and you
	need to make sure that the DSO is statically linked against each of
	them. 

	<a name="static"><h3>Statically linking mod_python into Apache.</h3></a>

      <ul>
	<li> Copy src/mod_python.c from the distribution you just untarred
	  into the Apache source tree under src/modules/extra:<br>
	  (assuming Apache sources are in apache_1.3.12)
	  <pre>
    $ cp mod_python-xxx/src/mod_python.c apache_1.3.12/src/modules/extra/
	  </pre>

	<li> A this point you have two choices, two ways to build Apache - 
	  the new "Apaci" or
	  the old "Configure". Use Apaci if you don't know the difference:
	  <br><br>
	  <b>EITHER</b> (Apaci)
	  <ul>
	    <li> Run ./configure from Apache directory telling it to activate
	      the Python module, then make to compile Apache:
	      <pre>
     $ cd apache_1.3.12
     $ ./configure --activate-module=src/modules/extra/mod_python.c
     $ make
	      </pre>
	  </ul>

	  <b>OR</b> (Configure)

	  <ul>
	    <li> Cd into the src directory, edit the Configuration file to
	      add the module, run Configure, then make to compile Apache:
	      <pre>
     $ cd apache_1.3.12/src
     $ vi Configuration
       [add a line "AddModule modules/extra/mod_python.c"]
     $ ./Configure
     $ make
	      </pre>
	  </ul>
	<li> Now either run "make install" to install Apache for the
	first time, or (more likely) simply copy over the new
	<b>httpd</b> binary to wherever Apache is on your system. This
	step will probably require root. E.g.:
	  <pre>
      $ su
      # cp src/httpd /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
	  </pre>
	<li> Finally start (or restart) Apache. This is typically done like this:
	  <pre>
      # /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl stop
      # /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
	  </pre>
	<li> If Apache didn't start, refer to the 
	  <a href="#trouble">Troubleshooting</a> section below.
      </ul>

      <a name="dynamic"><h3>Compiling mod_python as a DSO.</h3></a>
 
      The DSO compilation should be a simple process involving the
      <code>apxs</code> tool included with Apache, but due to
      differences in the dynamic linking mechanism and other
      subtleties, the procedure varies from system to system. Below
      are some notes on the successful installations I've been able to
      perform on systems I have access to. The future plan is to improve
      this procedure and hopefully come up with a simple script that
      will compile a DSO on your system. Until then, however, these
      notes is all I have:

<pre>

    On Linux, I was able to get dso to work the following way:

    [Linux 2.2.14, Debian potato, gcc 2.9.52, Apache 1.3.12,
     standard Debian Python development package installed]

    1. cd src/modules/extra
    2. axps -I /usr/local/include/python1.5 -c mod_python.c \
            /usr/local/lib/python1.5/config/libpython1.5.a -lpthread
      (You don't nead -lpthread if your Python is compiled without threads)


    On FreeBSD 4.0 STABLE (May 14 2000), the Python port from the ports
    collection is compiled with threads, but Apache is not. On FreeBSD, bjects 
    linked with thread support are linked against a different version of libc - 
    libc_r, and I do not think you can mix the two. The best solution is to
    quickly download and compile Python and link against that:

    1. tar xzvf py152.tgz
    2. cd Python-1.5.2
    3. ./configure
    4. make
    5. now cd to the mod_python directory 
    6. cd src/modules/extra
    7. apxs -I ~/src/Python-1.5.2/Include -I ~/src/Python-1.5.2 \
       -c mod_python.c ~/src/Python-1.5.2/libpython1.5.a -lm


    On Solaris 2.7 (SPARC), egcs-2.91.66. Again, I wasn't able to get it to
    work with threads, so just like with FreeBSD (above) the easiest thing is
    to quickly compile Python. The apxs command is then the same as for FreeBSD. 

    If, upon starting Apache, you get an error mentioning the unresolved 
    __eprintf symbol, do this:

    1. Find where your libgcc is (try "locate libgcc"). Mine was in 
      /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/egcs-2.91.66/libgcc.a

    2. Extract the object, containing the __eprintf using ar:
       ar -x /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/egcs-2.91.66/libgcc.a \
      _eprintf.o

    3. Now run apxs, but add _eprintf.o as the last argument. This will link the
       object in and should solve the problem. 
      </pre>

      <a name="testing"><h2>3. Testing</h2></a>

      <ul>
	<li> If you compiled mod_python as a DSO, you will need to
	tell Apache to load the module by adding the following line in
	the Apache configuration file, usually called
	<code>httpd.conf</code> or <code> apache.conf</code>
	(assuming you placed <code>mod_python.so</code> in the <code>libexec</code>
	directory in the <code>ServerRoot</code>) :
	  <pre>
      LoadModule python_module libexec/mod_python.so
	  </pre>

	<li> If your Apache configuration uses
	<code>ClearModuleList</code> directive, you will need to add
	mod_python to the module list in the Apache configuration file:
	  <pre>
      AddModule mod_python.c</pre>

	<li> Make some directory that would be visible on your website, for 
	  example, <code>htdocs/test</code>.

	<li> Add the following Apache directives, which can appear in either the 
	  main server configuration file, or <code>.htaccess</code>. If you
	are going to be using the <code>.htaccess</code> file, make
	sure the <code>AllowOverride</code> directive applicable to this
	directory has at least <code>FileInfo</code> specified.  The
	default is <code>None</code>, which will not work.
	  <pre>
      AddHandler python-program .py
      PythonHandler test
      PythonDebug </pre>

	<li> At this time, if you made changes to the main configuration file, 
	  you will need to restart Apache in order for the changes to take effect.

	<li> Edit <code>test.py</code> file in the <code>htdocs/test</code> 
	  directory so that is has the following lines:
	  <pre>
      from mod_python import apache

      def handler(req):
          req.send_http_header()
          req.write("Hello World!")
          return apache.OK </pre>

	<li> Point your browser to the URL referring to the test.py, you should
	  see "Hellow World!". If you didn't - refer to the troubleshooting step
	  next.
      </ul>
      
      <a name="trouble"><h2>4. Troubleshooting</h2></a>

      There are a couple things you can try to identify the problem:

      <ul>
	<li> Carefully study the error output, if any.
	<li> Check the error_log file, it may contain useful clues.
	<li> Try running Apache from the command line with an -X argument:
	  <pre>
      ./httpd -X</pre>
	  This prevents it from backgrounding itself and may provide some useful
	  information.
	<li> Ask on the mod_python list. Make sure to provide 
	  specifics such as:<br>
	  . Your operating system type, name and version.<br>
	  . Your Python version, and any unusual compilation options.<br>
	  . Your Apache version.<br>
	  . Relevant parts of the Apache config, .htaccess.<br>
	  . Relevant parts of the Python code.<br>
      </ul>
