    <h1>CGI Handler</h1>

    CGI handler is a handler that emulates the CGI environment under mod_python.
    
    <p>
      To use it, simply add this to your .htaccess file:
      <pre>
         SetHandler python-program
         PythonHandler cgihandler
    </pre>
    <p>
      <h3>CGI is not exactly the same as cgihandler</h3>
    <p>
      The cgihandler reloads the module for every hit. However, the modules imported
      by the main module do not get reloaded. This is good for performance, but if
      your CGI scripts relied on this functionality, they will be broken.
    <p>
      In my tests, the cgihandler was leaking some memory. I haven't been
      able to figure out why, I suspect it has something to do with having to reload
      the same module a lot.
