See the HTML documentation in the doc directory for installation
instructions and documentation.

If you can't read instructions:

	$ ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/sbin/apxs

	$ make dso
	$ su
	# make install

	Edit apache.conf like instructions at the end of "make install"
	tell you.

	If the above worked - read the tutorial in the doc directory.
