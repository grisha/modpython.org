<PRE>&gt;<i> Still not short enough, so much so I stopped part way through.
</I>
And for that I apologize.  I do appreciate the straight answer given,
though I would appreciate much more the addition of that fact in some
point-blank documentation that was easy to find.  I have scoured the
mod_python archives by search engine and came out utterly empty
handed.  I knew what the problem was, but I could find nothing to
remedy the issue.  I haven't encountered anything quite like this in
my adventures with PHP, perl, or other similar scripting languages
piloted by Apache.  It raises a valid concern to which I ideally
should have found answers very quickly.

I hope this cures the subsequent issue given in the latter half of my message.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello all-- I've been experiencing a caching issue from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very beginning of my use of mod_python...  It's been at least 2 months now,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I keep running into actual issues that prevent me from coding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a knack for over-explaining, so I'll try to keep this concise yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; descriptive.

</I>&gt;<i> The simple matter of it is that mod_python does not do deep checking
</I>&gt;<i> of code for changes, nor does it automatically restart the process
</I>&gt;<i> when code is changed. Thus the need to restart Apache when you make
</I>&gt;<i> code changes to anything imported from sys.path is expected and normal
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only time any code is automatically reloaded is the direct code

</I>&gt;<i> Graham
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm developing a site on my local machine, Windows Vista, using Apache 2.2.x
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and mod_python 3.3.1 .  I'm a programmer for a living, and I'm not quick to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point the finger at the language, *but* (you knew that was coming, eh?) I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know my code isn't to blame for the issue:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I write some basic code for an 'index.py' file, using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mod_python.publisher handler.  'index.py' includes other modules which I've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coded from that same location, etc, etc.  Nothing fancy.  Any changes I make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the 'index.py' file will be reflected immediately on my local web server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  On the other hand, any changes I make to the modules included via import
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from within 'index.py' are completely ignored by the web server.  It took me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a while to realize that my pages didn't reflect my code.  I also discovered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the .pyc files had nothing to do with it.  I finally just restarted the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apache web service (which in fact runs as a service on my machine), and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my code finally gets pushed through to the web server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been looking around practically every other day for documentation on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how to make apache/mod_python simply cut it out and stop caching my python
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code, but I've found nothing.  You can imagine the annoyance this presents,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since I have to restart my web server every single time I make even the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slightest change to a 'utility.py' file, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been coping with the problem for a while now, but then I've found far
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more annoying issues recently.  To abbreviate the problem into short terms,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've got a main module 'MAIN' which imports another module for a class
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'CLASS'.  CLASS also has a few imports, such as 'backend' stuff for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interfacing with various databases, etc.  We'll call the 'backend' module
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;BACKEND&quot;.  Given the setup, any changes I make to CLASS or BACKEND require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an apache restart in order to take effect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a function in CLASS which calls a function from it's imported BACKEND
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; module.  I tried adding a parameter to the BACKEND function in question, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properly passed said parameter while in CLASS, yet the mod_python debugger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spits out an error about me having passed 3 arguments, when the BACKEND
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function takes exactly 2.  This is outright false, since my function in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BACKEND looks like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; def getUsers(self, req, terms):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I'm calling it with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; self.backend.getUsers(self.req, search)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In reality, my code dictates that I'm passing 3 (including the implicit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'self' argument), and BACKEND's 'getUsers' does in fact take exactly 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arguments.  Yet, the debugger is telling me that it takes only 2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was trying to pass it 'req' because I wanted to investigate a little error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the code by printing something to the output HTML.  So, my attempt is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; foiled, since somewhere something isn't being updated to what my most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current code actually says.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just to test, I made the 'getUsers' function return immediately with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; string of gibberish, like 'return &quot;adsfasdfadsfa&quot;'.  this should make my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other code spin wildly out of control and encounter errors, yet when I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restart apache and test it... lo and behold, it's completely ignoring my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goofy 'return' statement.  The 'getUsers' function is still somehow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; returning valid data, as if the 'return' wasn't there at all!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So then I tried causing actual syntax errors.  The debugger caught this,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much to my inner joy.  So I tried causing a semantic error instead:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; referencing a non-existent attribute of a non-existent variable:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; madeUpVar.moo = 42
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Syntactically, nothing wrong, but at run time it should most definitely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; encounter a NameError or something equally as realistic.  But I restart
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apache, and... nothing.  The line is completely ignored.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which leads me to believe that it's not actually being 'ignored' per se, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather the code being compiled is not the same as the code in play within
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the web server.  When I delete my .pyc files and restart apache and visit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the URL that triggers my python code, my .py files are in fact being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recompiled down to their byte code .pyc files.  And clearly the interpreter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is processing my code, since it flags me on improper syntax.  Yet, no matter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what kind of syntactically-sound nonsense I put into my code, the changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aren't being reflected in my web server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These problems come and go, and I've go better explanation than over zealous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; caching.  I imagine that by tomorrow sometime when I start my computer up,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the problem will have disappeared for the time being.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've cursed this computer up and down as I've tried to figure out ANYTHING
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that I can do to alleviate the issue, by to no avail.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anybody with counsel to spare my tired brain is welcome to share...
