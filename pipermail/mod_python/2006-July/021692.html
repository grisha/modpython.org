</I>There is lots of needs for this in an Ajax world. For example Jetty 
(<A HREF="http://www.mortbay.com/MB/log/gregw/?permalink=ScalingConnections.html">http://www.mortbay.com/MB/log/gregw/?permalink=ScalingConnections.html</A>), 
Apache 2.2, and IIS a few years can do asynchronous processing. There 
are two ways to do asynchronous processing. The first is to lock onto 
the request and hold it and move it into a &quot;secondary&quot; processing area. 
The second is to start a task and then ask if any data has been 
generated. The running task will store in a cache that is then picked up 
by another request at another time.

The big idea here is to mimic an architecture where the server &quot;calls&quot; 
the client, which is very popular in Ajax.
&gt;<i> When Apache is using multiple processes, it will terminate child 
</I>&gt;<i> processes for various reasons (for example, when 
</I>&gt;<i> max_requests_per_child has been reached). That will also terminate any 
</I>&gt;<i> thread you created in that process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah I was looking at this and it is pain. On Windows Apache does not do 
this. They use only two processes and use threads within those processes.
&gt;<i> I suspect your software gets a &quot;job&quot; from the user, and reports back 
</I>&gt;<i> to the user that the job has been started. The job itself must keep 
</I>&gt;<i> running for some time after that. The job creates a file or something 
</I>&gt;<i> similar which can make the user conclude that the job has finished.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I would not say &quot;job&quot;. I would say long running tasks generating data. 
For example I like to read real-time feeds, and want to generate the 
data. But the client is in control of the task using parameters that are 
sent to server.
&gt;<i> A web service used within a web server is not redundant, it's just a 
</I>&gt;<i> way to delegate tasks to other machines or processes. This is 
</I>&gt;<i> typically done for security reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't really buy this argument. Let's say I do what you recommend and 
that is call an XML-RPC service. Why, do I need Apache in the first 
place? While I might get security I don't get any added value. If I am 
using web services then Apache is pretty well useless anyways because 
most web services don't use HTTP security. Most web service 
infrastructures use the WS-* specs, or some home-backed tokens that are 
added to the XML package.
