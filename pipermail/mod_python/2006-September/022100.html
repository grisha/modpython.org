<PRE>&gt;<i>Have you added logging in your authenhandler and know for sure that it is
</I>being called?

Yep, it's definitely being called

&gt;<i>I am not very good at mod_rewrite, but I read this as you using mod_rewrite
</I>to proxy the request 
&gt;<i>through to a backend server. If this is true and your expectation is that
</I>the cookie will be passed
&gt;<i>through to the backend to be used there somehow before perhaps also being
</I>sent back to the client,
&gt;<i>your assumption would be wrong. This is because setting a cookie in the
</I>authenhandler is going to be 
&gt;<i>done in the headers_out where only headers_in would be getting proxied
</I>through.

&gt;<i>Is that what you were expecting?
</I>
Yeah, that's what I was expecting or wanted to happen. Is there any way of
setting a cookie in the handler that can be read by the back-end server?
Maybe changing headers_in?

Thanks &amp; reagrds

Guy
