As Jim effectively commented, mod_python is more than just a jumping off
point for a content handler. It is quite sad (and frustrating) at times to see
that more often than not people ignore all the richness that Apache offers.
They just want to use Python for absolutely everything when there are other
modules or features provided by Apache that could be used in conjunction
with mod_python and their own Python code to get the job done quicker and
more efficiently. More than anything else, this is why mod_python development
has languished, because the majority of people cant seem to see the bigger
picture. It is only with mod_python 3.3 that one will be able to finally do
with mod_python what mod_perl people have had for years and even then
we still don't go anywhere near as far as they do in being able to harness
the full power of Apache.

Anyway, that is my grumpy rant for this week.

In respect of AddHandler/SetHandler/MultiViews, I now have a article of
my own up on my still not officially launched personal wiki pages about it.

  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/ModPython/Articles/SetHandlerVersusAddHandler">http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/ModPython/Articles/SetHandlerVersusAddHandler</A>

This has been referenced on the developers list, but not here as yet.
