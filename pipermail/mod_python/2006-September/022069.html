Because we now have our own, as of Sept 12! We've not made an official 
announcement on this list yet, as I wanted to have a discussion on what 
should go in the wiki vs. the official documentation vs. the website 
before we starting piling in. There is a problem potential licensing 
problem if we use the wiki for the official documentation and then in 
turn want to distribute those docs with the mod_python source.

&gt;&gt;<i> In respect of mod_python vs mod_python.publisher, they are actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two totally different things. In some respects, mod_python.publisher
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and mod_python.psp should be released as totally separate products
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the mod_python core. That they aren't often causes a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confusion as people, like yourself, see mod_python.publisher and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mod_python as one in the same, when in fact mod_python.publisher
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a higher level interface which is used in a totally different way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup. It might make more sense to distinguish it as an add-on (or at 
</I>&gt;<i> least flag the differences clearly for novices).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In respect of AddHandler, SetHandler, MultiViews etc, you need to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that mod_python is an extension for Apache. Thus, such things like this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aren't actually implemented by mod_python but are implemented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by Apache. To use mod_python properly, you also need to understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apache to some degree and that means also referring to the Apache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which, IMHO, is even more obscurantist than the mod_python 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. It seems to assume you've already read much of the source 
</I>&gt;<i> code and are familiar with C ... in which case why would you be using 
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python in the first place :-) ?
</I>
Graham can speak for himself of course, but I don't think he meant the C 
API. You need to understand the various phases of Apache request 
processing to really use the full potential of mod_python. This 
understanding is independent of the Apache C API, but will be new 
territory for someone coming from something like of php (as an example). 
In this respect our documentation could be *much* better. I think people 
can get really excited about the possibilities once they realize the 
power that mod_python offers. It's more than just a nice way to run some 
python scripts.
