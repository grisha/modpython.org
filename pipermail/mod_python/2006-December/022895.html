&gt;<i> As to whether it is possible to implement a mod_perl like module for
</I>&gt;<i> Python, it is, it can work and it is simpler than one might expect
</I>&gt;<i> as SWIG works quite well for this. I already have basic bindings
</I>&gt;<i> working as proof of concept.
</I>
Oooh. Yes please.


&gt;<i> The second option is to implement the new module as a broad enough
</I>&gt;<i> framework that the existing mod_python API could be implemented as a
</I>&gt;<i> personality on top of it. So, one looks at this other way around and
</I>&gt;<i> says that the new module is technically a much better solution and
</I>&gt;<i> bless it as the way forward. The API of mod_python could then be
</I>&gt;<i> supported as just one of many restrictive APIs on top of the new
</I>&gt;<i> module, thus allowing support of older code as well as allowing
</I>&gt;<i> development of new personalities and extension modules for
</I>&gt;<i> Apache. As a further example, WSGI could be just another personality
</I>&gt;<i> on top of the new module.
</I>
Oooh. Yes please.


&gt;<i> With a new module which exposes better the Apache APIs, examples of
</I>&gt;<i> things you could do are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    mod_authn_python - Implement an auth provider using Python code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    mod_dav_python - Implement a dav provider using Python code.
</I>
Oooh! Oooh! Yes please!

(I really need this right now - I've looked at implementing ALL of DAV
but it's such a moronic protocol I really don't want to).


&gt;<i> So, although I may have grand plans for world domination along these
</I>&gt;<i> lines, in practice I don't see it going very far, at least not under
</I>&gt;<i> the umbrella of the existing mod_python project. What exactly I will
</I>&gt;<i> do with these ideas and the code I have already developed I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know yet. I see I have two choices at present. These are to work on
</I>&gt;<i> it myself out of my own site as a personal project purely for
</I>&gt;<i> curiosity value. The second is to get an Apache labs project created
</I>&gt;<i> for it and work on it there. In the latter, because it is under the
</I>&gt;<i> umbrella of the Apache Software Foundation, it doesn't rule out it
</I>&gt;<i> someday perhaps being adopted as an official front line
</I>&gt;<i> project. Doing it as an Apache labs project would also make it
</I>&gt;<i> easier to migrate at least some of the ideas over to mod_python so
</I>&gt;<i> as to improve the existing code base.
</I>
I think you should do this in the quickest way possible. I'd probably
help a bit with somethings.
