<PRE>&gt;<i> Certainly. I think a well constructed advocacy site with screencasts
</I>&gt;<i> and shiny 3D icons could help filter out people who only think they
</I>&gt;<i> need mod_python and direct them to other projects. To be honest, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure I *need* mod_python. I'd be happy with python over FastCGI on
</I>&gt;<i> Apache.
</I>I don't want this discussion to get side tracked on the screencast
issue. John Udell is a big proponent of them and I included it as a
part of the quote for completeness.  The other part of the the quote -
distribution/installation is the part I am most interested in.  The
screencasts and other shiny marketing bobbles will come after that.

&gt;<i> I believe that most shared hosting consumers that desire mod_python
</I>&gt;<i> just want python with the performance of mod_php rather than CGI.
</I>&gt;<i> Mod_python, by being associated with Apache and by not requiring
</I>&gt;<i> additional software layers like Django, seems like the least complex
</I>&gt;<i> choice. I know this is how I became initially attracted to it. I think
</I>&gt;<i> this particular crowd can be very happy running python CGI for most
</I>&gt;<i> things. It's generally available, although not always advertised.
</I>&gt;<i> However, CGI is unfashionable and &quot;slow&quot;. *shrugs* In all my python
</I>&gt;<i> CGI code, I've found the bottleneck to be the poor design choices I
</I>&gt;<i> make at 4 am.
</I>
I believe that in the future, most consumers will be as interested in
what their blogging software is written in as they are currently
knowledgeable about what language their word processor is written in.
