</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I saw there was a discussion on this topic already:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2006-May/021260.html">http://www.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2006-May/021260.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and came up with the same wish -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I want to force a session cookie to be explicitly created for https.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have added a &quot;secure&quot; parameter to the session class constructors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it is set AND req.is_https(), the cookie will be created wiht &quot;secure&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A diff of session.py in release 3.2.10 with this feature is available on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://neoscientists.org/~plex/mod_python_3_2_10_session_with_secure_cookie.diff">http://neoscientists.org/~plex/mod_python_3_2_10_session_with_secure_cookie.diff</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest that an explicit argument to Session.Session() is probably
</I>&gt;<i> not the best way of doing this. I am also dubious of it only being set
</I>&gt;<i> if HTTPS is used as that suggests that if first access is not via HTTPS,
</I>&gt;<i> that one could then continue to access the site thereafter without it
</I>&gt;<i> needing it to be HTTPS which defeats the purpose of having it in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place as you want to probably force it to be HTTPS always and not
</I>&gt;<i> allow HTTP at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In place of an argument to Session.Session(), a PythonOption setting
</I>&gt;<i> would possibly be more appropriate and would then be similar with how
</I>&gt;<i> other aspects of cookies are configured for sessions. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   PythonOption mod_python.session.secure: 1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By being an option it is easier to apply it to the complete URL
</I>&gt;<i> namespace for an application, especially if application is coded poorly
</I>&gt;<i> and doesn't have all session creation performed in one place only, or
</I>&gt;<i> you can't modify the code for the application easily.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In being set this way, 'secure' should also perhaps always be set,
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of whether HTTPS is used. The outcome of this is that the
</I>&gt;<i> client would never send the cookie back if it wasn't HTTPS, thus result
</I>&gt;<i> would be always being pushed back to the login form (session creation
</I>&gt;<i> point) if not HTTPS, thereby clearly indicating that something is wrong
</I>&gt;<i> and also not inadvertently still letting someone in by accident through
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another possible issue is whether through Session instance it should be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to access the cookie properties and interrogate if the cookie
</I>&gt;<i> for a session had the 'secure' attribute. If you don't have a means of
</I>&gt;<i> validating that it was secure cookie, then someone could modify the
</I>&gt;<i> cookie on the client side, remove the secure attribute and change from
</I>&gt;<i> using HTTPS to HTTP and possibly start to reveal information in traffic
</I>&gt;<i> that you didn't want to be revealed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the latter point, one could argue that setting the PythonOption
</I>&gt;<i> should also be a trigger for the Session class to perform a validation
</I>&gt;<i> and always reject any cookie that doesn't have the 'secure' flag,
</I>&gt;<i> presuming that the 'secure' flag is actually sent back with the cookie
</I>&gt;<i> by the client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I understood that browsers would flag cookies as secure if they received 
them over https, and maintain separation between secure and non-secure 
cookies. I wouldn't expect to see the secure flag represented inside the 
cookie, as the two sets (secure and non-secure) should be disjoint. This 
can cause session maintenance problems when some pages in the session 
are http and others are https.

&gt;<i> Thus, I can seem merit in what you are trying to achieve, but it perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> needs some more thought as to how it should be achieved to ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> there aren't back doors in the way it is done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I agree that the proposed solution was a bit lame, though in the right 
spirit.
