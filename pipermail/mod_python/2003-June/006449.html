Actually, I'll go a step further than that -- every single item you put
in the httpd.conf file (including the 'AuthName' and 'AuthType'
directives in 3.4) is an Apache directive.  Linking mod_python into
Apache lets you use some Apache directives that you wouldn't have access
to otherwise (all the Python*Handler directives), but they're still
_Apache_ directives -- and it's important to keep that in mind.

You're right, by the way --  you and I are coming at this from opposite
ends.  I've been managing Apache for years now, and am new to Python.

So yeah, this definitely indicates something of a shortcoming of the
mod_python tutorial (not really the only one, I think, judging by how
many people have problems getting mod_python to work as they'd expect).
