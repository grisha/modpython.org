yes

&gt;<i> When mod_python is initialized it creates an interpreter called

correct

&gt;<i> Where is the main interpreter named &quot;main_interpreter&quot;?  Can I access that

</I>
It is named inside the C code for mod_python. If force your interpreter
name by using &quot;PythonInterpreter main_interpreter&quot;, then mod_python won't
create subinterpreters, it will just select &quot;main_interpreter&quot; to run
things.

&gt;<i> If apache is running as multiple processes and maybe multiple threads how
</I>&gt;<i> many main_interpreters are there?  Just one?
</I>
As many as there are processes.

&gt;<i> Asside: req.interpreter doesn't work for me (under 3.0.0 (was it
</I>&gt;<i> added in 3.0.1 or 3.0.2) or am I confused?
</I>
3.0.0 is a beta version, you should stay away from it anyway.

&gt;<i> When do the sub-interpreters get created?
</I>
on first use

&gt;<i> The sub-interpreters are, by default, associated associated with a virtual
</I>&gt;<i> server name (but there can be more than one sub-interpreter per virtual
</I>&gt;<i> server name).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that right?
</I>
yes, if you use InterpPerDirective or InterpPerDirectory

&gt;<i> If there are mutliple processes of apache with multiple threads, are the
</I>&gt;<i> sub-interpreters shared betweenn processes and/or threads?
</I>
between threads within a process - yes, between processes - no.

&gt;<i> When a http request comes in that uses a mod_python handler, it is
</I>&gt;<i> assigned to a sub-interpreter.  It might be assigned to a brand new
</I>&gt;<i> sub-interpreter (usually if traffic on the server is reaching a new high
</I>&gt;<i> level), or a previously used sub-interpreter (if traffic is less than it
</I>&gt;<i> was at peak).  (Assuming we keep hitting the same virtual
</I>&gt;<i> server/directory/etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that right?
</I>
sort-of... Apache will assign a request to one of it's children/threads to
be serviced. Mod_python will determine subinterpreter name based on
config, if this this subinterpreter already exists within this child, it's
reused, otherwise a new one is created. Server load is only one of a few
reasons why there may be a new child process.

&gt;<i> Sub-interpreters are never destoryed, so the number of sub-interpreters
</I>&gt;<i> increases monotonically from when apache is started until it dies and
</I>&gt;<i> your chances of getting a used sub-interpreter goes up the longer apache
</I>&gt;<i> has been running.
</I>
true (note though that there is a finite number of subinterpeters, e.g. if
you're using the default interp per vrtual host, then there will only be
as many subinterpreters per process as there are virtual hosts - thus it
increases up to a point when all possible subinterpeters are created, then
it stops)

&gt;<i> Also the longer apache is running the more memory mod_python would
</I>&gt;<i> proabely use.
</I>
this depends on how your code is written. mod_python itself has no known
memory leaks - but if you fnd any, let us know!

&gt;<i> If apache reduces (kills) the processes it is running, are any
</I>&gt;<i> sub-interpreters affected?
</I>
well - everything in the process (inclduing subinterpreters) is affected.

&gt;<i> If you happen to get a re-used sub-interpreter, you will also get saddled
</I>&gt;<i> with stuff that was defined in it before.
</I>
yes

&gt;<i> This can be a good thing or a bad thing.  If you are accessing a database,
</I>&gt;<i> the sub-interpreter may already have an open DB connection which can save
</I>&gt;<i> you time.  It may also have already loaded some of the modules that your
</I>&gt;<i> code calls, which can save time.  Unfortunately this can be bad as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One case occurs when you modify python code that is included as a module.
</I>&gt;<i> If you get a sub-interpreter where the original version of the module
</I>&gt;<i> has already been included, it will use that instead of the new one.
</I>
But how is this bad? This is one of the main reasons mod_python is so fast
- module code is only interpreted once (as opposed to every request with
CGI).

&gt;<i> Another example of when getting a used sub-interpreter is bad might be:
</I>&gt;<i> User 1 writes a script that changes the sys.path variable and loads a
</I>&gt;<i> module that they have written called MyModule.  User 2 writes a script
</I>&gt;<i> that changes the sys.path variable and loads a different module that thay
</I>&gt;<i> have written called MyModule also!
</I>
this is precisely why you have subinterpreters - you need to make sure
that the users are running in separate subinterpreters.

&gt;<i> Obviously the solution to the above problem is to use a different
</I>&gt;<i> sub-interpreter naming scheme with &quot;PythonInterpPerDirectory or
</I>&gt;<i> PythonInterpPerDirective&quot;.
</I>
exactly!
