Subject: [mod_python] python3.3.3 -> make -> Error with apxs (OSX
	10.6.8) (#21)

My guess is it's not liking the blanks in /Volumes/Mac OS
X/Users/tobias/Downloads/mod_python_git/mod_python/src/include...

This may actually be a bug with the ./configure script - it should
perhaps be wrapping paths in quotes, not sure. As a quick work-around,
I'd try creating a symlink to Users that contains no spaces.

Mind you - I remember having to compile Python 3.3.3rc1 manually on
OSX (with ./configure --enable-shared), the binary package from
python.org as well as brew version weren't quite working on Mavericks,
but this may be fixed now.
