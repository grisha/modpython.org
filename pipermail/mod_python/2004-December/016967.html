Senior Software Engineer, Google.com (SRE)
Positions based in Dublin Ireland.

Are you part ace coder, part adrenalin junkie? Do you have a knack for 
seeing a problem and immediately discerning the likely solution? Maybe 
you've been coding for years, are bored with the old 
design-build-review-test-ship-repeat routine, and yearn for some 
faster-paced challenges? Or perhaps you're a seasoned software engineer 
who is also a genius at jockeying networks and administering UNIX 
clusters.

We're looking for top-notch thrill seeking, software engineers to join the 
Google.com team. Google.com engineers are in the thick of everything 
involved with keeping Google running, from code-level troubleshooting of 
traffic anomalies to maintenance of our most cutting edge services; from 
monitoring and alerts to building new automation infrastructure. We are 
aggressively building this elite team of high level engineers in this 
mission critical environment. All team members must have strong analytical 
and troubleshooting skills, fluency in coding, good communication skills, 
and most of all enthusiasm for tackling the complex problems of scale 
which are uniquely Google. Google.com engineers tackle challenging, novel 
situations every day, and work with just about every other engineering and 
operations team in the process.

Qualifications:

.Strong programming/scripting skills in any of the following: Python, C,
  C++, Java, Perl
.BA/BS in CS, or equivalent experience.
.In-depth knowledge of Unix (preferably Linux), networking, and shell
  scripting.

  of urgency.

.5+ years experience in a similar position a big plus.
.Experience with Unix system administration a plus.
