Right, and in a development environment (the only place one would use a
reloader) I suppose that would be acceptable.  However, if you're testing
against the production database server (a not-unreasonable proposition for a
small to midsize shop with a complex database schema), all those extra
connections might prove to be a burden.  And you can't guarantee that Python
will close them when the module is &quot;unloaded&quot;, as the module may continue to
exist for some time.

I'm sorry to be pedantic.  I'm not arguing that such a feature is *required*,
or necessary for any purpose (gee, don't test against your production
database server!), but that it would have *some* benefits, at *minimal* cost
(see below regarding cost), and is thus a win overall.

</I>
As to the first suggestion (a mechanism for a module to say &quot;don't remove
me!&quot;), that is already supported in that you do not reload Python standard
modules.  Perhaps you could add a check for a __no_reload__ symbol or the
like?

Regarding permanent variables, under ordinary Python reload semantics, you
can do something like:

try:
  x = my_retained_variable
  del x
except:
  my_retained_variable = initial_value

but that's just for the record.  I can't see why you could possibly want to
do that, *particularly* in mod_python.   :-)
