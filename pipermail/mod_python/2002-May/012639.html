Ah!  I had forgotten MaxRequestsPerChild, which lets Apache take care of
counting reloads, so a Python reloader need not worry about it.

I don't disagree.  You'll note that I'm arguing for features on the basis of
developer convenience at minimal (but not zer) performance cost, which
translates into developer productivity.

&gt;<i> In deployment mode, there shouldn't be any bloat because the .py files
</I>&gt;<i> won't change.  The cost is just stat'ing them each time, which is a
</I>&gt;<i> slight cost but not terrible.
</I>
And the cost will be zero, if AutoReload is turned off :-)

</I>
True, but there are valid reasons to want to test and develop such
opportunistic caching mechanisms (since anything opportunistic is by at least
a little bit nondeterministic, it probably needs the most testing).  There
are also performance implications, as I detailed in my other reply in this
thread (&lt;<A HREF="http://mailman.modpython.org/mailman/listinfo/mod_python">20020530004544.GF2519 at eleanor.internal.ywlcs.org</A>&gt;).  As I said a few
paragraphs earlier, developer convenience with minimal impact on
performance.

BTW: I assume you're not implying that opportunistic caching is overly
fragile!  It's a great technique!  Relying on not being reloaded, however, is
obviously stupid, since the Apache API *will* reload you :-)

I don't actually care too much about this whole thing; just putting in my
$0.02.  If y'all are really opposed to it, don't put it in.  I'll still love
you, and you can keep the pennies. :-)
