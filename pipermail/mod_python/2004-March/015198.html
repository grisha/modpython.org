<PRE>I believed you just summed up albatross/draco's take on &quot;the wheel&quot;.  I
prefer Albatross, but you should look at both:

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: RE: [mod_python] persistent, reliable globals
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a good point, vincent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> another more general question might be: given the proliferation of
</I>&gt;<i> application server frameworks, why another one?  the ironic thing is
</I>&gt;<i> that i decided to make this kit because i was not happy with how other
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks were &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; (from my point of view.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> what do i mean by this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) no extra servers: running another server behind apache is not that
</I>&gt;<i> difficult, but it seems like a waste to not use apache itself as a
</I>&gt;<i> server.  e.g. use the apache process model (which will be more
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly tested than any server i will write), http / ssl server,
</I>&gt;<i> request processing, configuration, logs, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) no toy languages: python is an excellent language.  use the
</I>&gt;<i> features of python (and not some funny interface to the features of
</I>&gt;<i> python) for your framework.  this means: use objects, modules and
</I>&gt;<i> packages, not a domain-specific component framekwork.  and, no
</I>&gt;<i> preprecessors / compilers: straight python.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> an example: i'm often think &quot;what is really going on&quot; when i read big
</I>&gt;<i> configuraiton files.  i've decided to make my configuration files
</I>&gt;<i> actual python, so it should be clear!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) be relatively feature-full.  this means: sessions, cookies,
</I>&gt;<i> authentication, caching.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1+2 = python programmers don't have to learn anything to get started.
</I>&gt;<i> i think grisha's publisher framework is a good example of this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> less important and unrelated concerns:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) template / database neutrality.  personally i'm anti-template, but
</I>&gt;<i> i see their usefulness, but people have religious opinions / legacy
</I>&gt;<i> systems to worry about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) finally, i selfishly want to see mod_python everywhere, like
</I>&gt;<i> mod_perl, so i thought by making a great framework that was tightly
</I>&gt;<i> bound to mod_python would help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ok, now my humble evaluation of some existing frameworks: i don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to start a flamewar, so let me start off by saying i really like a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of these, except where i say otherwise, and my opinions certainly
</I>&gt;<i> aren't set in stone if people want to convince me otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> zope: well this one i'm not a fan of.  there are plenty of anti-zope
</I>&gt;<i> web pages out there, so i'll leave it at that.  skunkweb, webware, and
</I>&gt;<i> cherrypy are all really much better, imho.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i've used skunkweb for a commercial site.  its caching and performance
</I>&gt;<i> are reputable, and is generally pleasant to use.  my complaints: its
</I>&gt;<i> session handling and authentication is less-than-mature.  (i
</I>&gt;<i> contributed some code to this.)  stml is nice, but i'm not a fan of
</I>&gt;<i> the component framework, which makes pages in a piece-meal fashion,
</I>&gt;<i> not in an object-oriented way.  the request processing framework is a
</I>&gt;<i> little hard to understand, or at least not well documented (though
</I>&gt;<i> this might be changing soon.)  the configuration is powerful but a bit
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelming.  (there's a FAQ &quot;my config file is so big!&quot;)  it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> install out-of-the-box into freebsd (what i use).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cheerypy i've played with.  i like it a lot too.  however i'm not a
</I>&gt;<i> fan of the toy language.  i've stolen remi's idea of using aspects in
</I>&gt;<i> web programming (which admittedly is a very old idea), but without a
</I>&gt;<i> preprocessor.  the fact that it is a compiler makes it hard to grovel
</I>&gt;<i> the source: your code gets munged together with a bunch of other code
</I>&gt;<i> which is hard to figure out where it came from.  again it has a
</I>&gt;<i> component framework which, while closely mapping to python's, is in
</I>&gt;<i> the toy language.  (i can't get emacs to do intentation properly!)
</I>&gt;<i> but it certainly is lightweight and object-oriented, and relatively
</I>&gt;<i> well-documented.  i had a lot of fun writing some test pages, and even
</I>&gt;<i> contributed a bugfix (to the authentication code, again.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> webware i've only read about so probably shouldn't comment on.  but i
</I>&gt;<i> will say after working at a startup, i have a phobia of phrases like
</I>&gt;<i> 3-tier, etc.  people seem to like webware though so maybe i should get
</I>&gt;<i> over my prejudices.  it's trying to be complete in a way that i'm not:
</I>&gt;<i> i think they want to replace zope (which is an admirable goal.)  i
</I>&gt;<i> don't want object-relational mappers built-in, i just want to control
</I>&gt;<i> how requests get processed and sent to you.  i do like using the java
</I>&gt;<i> servlet model though (which i've adopted: my kit is called &quot;pylets&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for now.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> pyro is really cool.  certainly it is an interesting way to go.
</I>&gt;<i> however i'm interested in tight binding with apache: no separate
</I>&gt;<i> server process to manage, use the apache logs, and of course the
</I>&gt;<i> performance you get by being inside apache.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i'm a couple days from pre-alpha release, mostly documentation work.
</I>&gt;<i> probably these emails i'm writing may form the start of the docs.
</I>&gt;<i> sorry to flood you all with my ramblings.  i hope people will play
</I>&gt;<i> with it, once it's out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> take care, Ben
