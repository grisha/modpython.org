<PRE>The more I play with this, the more I think the problem I'm seeing is 
because I'm not using the
security as it was designed.  I don't think apache likes a 'require' 
directive without an AuthType
or AuthName.  The only problem is, if I add those two directives, the user 
is prompted for a username
and password, which I want to avoid since I'm using SSL certs.

I changed the handler from an authen handler to an access handler. 
Everything works like a charm.
I guess I'll live with that. Although it's technically not the correct 
place to authenticate, it's close enough
not to be confusing.

Thanks everyone,
Perry Tew




Hello,
   I'm having a issue using both a PythonAuthenHandler and PythonHandler 
in the same &lt;Location&gt; directive.

The PythonAuthenHandler works when used within a &lt;Directory /www/cgi-bin/&gt; 

directive.
The PythonHandler works with a &lt;Location&gt; directive

However, when I add the Authen handler to the &lt;Location&gt; directive, my 
python handler is no longer called, instead, I receive a 404 stating that 
my uri was mapped to the htdocs directory and could not be found.   Allow 
me to illustrate:

&lt;Location /manager&gt;
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler TicketManager
&lt;/Location&gt;

The above works fine.  My python script is located in my PythonPath under 
the site-packages directory and is named TicketManager.py.

However, this doesn't work:
&lt;Location /manager&gt;
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler TicketManager

        PythonAuthenHandler TicketAuthenHandler
        require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;

Instead of seeing the output of my python script, I receive a 404 error 
and the following is displayed in my error_log:
[Tue Oct 07 00:13:59 2003] [error] [client 170.60.46.224] File does not 
exist: /web/devel/tewpe1/py/apache2/htdocs/manager

Again, the authen handler works when protecting a physical directory. Does 

anyone have any insight to this?  I know the security directives seem a 
little bare bones, but I'm not using Basic Auth, I'm using SSL Client 
Certs.  However, it does work.  My authen handler returns apache.OK. 

I also have a CleanupHandler defined (but not shown) and that is 
executing.


Thanks for your  time,
Perry Tew
