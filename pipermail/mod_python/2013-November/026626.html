<PRE>Hi,

I saw you were looking for help to test compiling the new mod_python on
Windows.

The good news: I got it compiled on Windows under Visual Studio 2010 - I
haven't tested it but it does spit out a so file (albeit it is not happy
with all the warnings but I got no errors).

The bad news:

*) Visual Studio 2010 doesn't support C99 (seriously Microsoft?) - so
variable declaration must be at the beginning of the scope (or before any
other statement besides a variable declaration). It does appear that they
did add C99 support in 2013 (
<A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/07/19/c99-library-support-in-visual-studio-2013.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/07/19/c99-library-support-in-visual-studio-2013.aspx</A>
)
so if you want to support anything below 2013 is up to you. My patch fixes
it for 2010.

*) There appears to be an issue with PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT on Windows (gcc
and VC++).

The following causes a &quot;error: initializer element is not constant&quot;

PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(&amp;PyType_Type, 0)

interestingly enough it compiles just fine under Linux/gcc. I even tried
using a newer version of gcc (on Windows) and still complains about it.
That macro expands to (at least according to gcc -E):

1, &amp;PyType_Type, 0,

on both Linux and Windows. While, I'm not a C expert I wasn't able to
figure out what is so different that it compiles fine on Linux and not
Windows. In any case there is some talk about it here:
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/modwsgi/4OLhmA1AbBs/CX0Y8cV0lyUJ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/modwsgi/4OLhmA1AbBs/CX0Y8cV0lyUJ</A>

In order to fix that I used this advice: <A HREF="http://bugs.python.org/issue10773">http://bugs.python.org/issue10773</A> and
replaced those lines with:

PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL, 0)

And initialized that field elsewhere.

To compile I downloaded the Apache source (including apr, apr-iconv,
apt-util, and httpd as well as compiled libraries from here:
<A HREF="http://www.apachelounge.com/download/win32/">http://www.apachelounge.com/download/win32/</A> ).

I also had to include finfooobject.c into the project file. I also may have
hacked some unresolved external symbols in there that it was complaining
about.

However, I was NOT able to compile it using MinGW/gcc - kept getting
unresolved externals so I'm no doubt missing a library somewhere....

The diff is against the latest in your git repo.

Let me know what you think.
