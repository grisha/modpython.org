Right-on, works for me!

Webware is a application server (in development) that does Servlets and
Server Pages in Python so what it really wants is a path into its servlet
directory so it can find the source, generate the content and send it back
through the handler. For now the mod_python handler is just a proxy that
marshals some data from the request,sends it to the application server via a
socket, and relays the response back to Apache. If I were using Directory I'd
have to make a physical directory somwhere just to contain the handler and
nothing else or I suppose I could put the handler in my servlet directory but
it just doesn''t seem to belong there. Using Location I can place the handler
with the other application server source files. That just seems cleaner for
now.
Of course, this is all making me think of what will happen when I want to put
server pages alongside static html and have the right thing happen when .html
or .psp (server pages) are called for, but I suppose there is some way to
coerce Apache into doing that.

Dave.
