&gt;<i>  ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally, I do have serious problems with all this 'privacy' in your 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; procedure. I think this is a public issue where everybody is concerned, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all communications on this topic should be in a 'public' forum, not private
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emails. You'll notice that I took great care in CC-ing everything I received
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on this to this public list, with the exception of couple of mails from you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Rimon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not a public issue. It's an issue for interested parties - which
</I>&gt;<i> is why I have been prepared to spend my own and others' bandwidth and
</I>&gt;<i> time to solicit opinions and volunteers from the appropriate forums.
</I>
Sounds like we have a big difference of views here. Let's agree to disagree.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> Care and foresight have certainly been key words in your handling of
</I>&gt;<i> this issue.
</I>
Touche :-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, this discussion has been going on for long enough and I thank
</I>&gt;<i> Grisha for letting it happen on this mailing list. 
</I>
Here we're in total agreement, so I'd like to join you in thanking Gregory.
Though, since mod_python is a core element of this topic (as far as I'm
concerned) I think it's only natural that such discussions take place on
precisely this public forum.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Vio, could you please let us know if the ASF board has replied?
</I>
Obviously. As previously mentionned, as far as I'm concerned, all emails 
related to this topic will be CC-ed to the mod_python list, for all to see
and have a chance to react to. This topic is of public interest.

Regards,
Vio
