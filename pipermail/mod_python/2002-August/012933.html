</I>
Note that &quot;Apache&quot; is beginning to mean a lot more than just &quot;the Apache
http server&quot;. You've now got projects such as Tomcat, Xerces, and Cocoon all
under the Apache banner. Arguably, they have nothing to do with the web
server :-)

My point is just that people won't arrive at the ASF simply for &quot;how to
interface to Apache with Python.&quot; Minor point to be sure, but hey :-)

&gt;<i> I'm a total ignorant about mod_snake, but in principle, promoting two siamese
</I>&gt;<i> twins accomplishing pretty much the same tricks implies a good waste of 
</I>&gt;<i> developer cycles (and other less valuable resources).
</I>
Each developer has the *right to choose* what they work on. You might call
it a waste, but those developers have a bunch of other reasons for why they
may work on duplicative code. For example, the Apache Tomcat guys have got a
web server built into their code. I ask, &quot;what the hell? use Apache httpd!&quot;
But even though that is a valid answer, some developers want a pure Java
solution, so they build a Java-based HTTP server. Even though (*IMO*) it is
a huge waste of effort. But it's their choice.

&gt;<i>...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I do think a &quot;sister sites&quot; link area is a good idea, as well as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; some kind of mod_python CPAN.
</I>
More on this in a sec.

&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This makes a lot of sense.
</I>&gt;<i> So the 'functional' hierarchy Greg Stein is promoting for the apache site
</I>&gt;<i> might look something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP Server &gt; modules &gt; sister sites 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks to me much more consistent that what we have now, 
</I>&gt;<i> ... while making (most) everyone happy :)
</I>
I'd like to clarify my thoughts here (I've said this elsewhere, but not to
this forum, nor in a very public forum). Currently, the ASF has projects
aligned along *language* boundaries. For a certain selection of developer
and goal, this can be quite fine. &quot;I need a Java-based MTA.&quot;

However, it starts to fall down when a question such as &quot;I want a Java-based
XML parser.&quot; Is that in the ASF Jakarta Project, or the ASF XML Project?
Hunh. If everything were organized along *functional* lines, then the
question could always be answered properly. &quot;An MTA? Go to the server
project. It will be in there.&quot; &quot;An XML Parser? Go to the XML project.&quot; Of
course, you'd then select for the language of choice. But that is a
secondary criteria after the initial project selection.

Thus, I would not advocate something along the lines of python.apache.org.
&quot;All things Python&quot; doesn't help users looking for functionality, and it
tends to end up as a mish-mash of unrelated (Python) projects.

As a result, I would advocate mod_python as part of the Apache HTTP Server
Project itself. You've got a web server, and (hey!) here is the Python
connector. I would even advocate that mod_perl, mod_(d)tcl, and mod_php move
to this same organization (and whack those language specific projects).
Jakarta is just too frickin' huge to axe so easily :-), but there are lines
of functionality for that project, too.

In this view, vio is correct on my suggestion: the Apache HTTP Server
Project is the parent. Sub-projects include things like mod_python. And as a
matter of course, we simply refer people to other locations for other
httpd-related software.

[ and to clarify: I'm speaking of my opinion on ASF organization, rather
  than thru any official capacity ]

Back to the CPAN-like thing. Given the above view, how does this work?
Well... consider having some kind of &quot;indexing&quot; or &quot;cataloging&quot; project.
Language neutral. Sure, you could select by language, but why would it be
limited to just Perl or just Python? Why not both and Java and Tcl and Ruby
software?

*That* would be interesting. The trouble with such a beast, though, is
simply that it is such a hard problem to put together well. If it was easy,
it would have been done. And the ASF generally prefers to avoid the &quot;dead
SourceForge project&quot; syndrome. We're much more about *communities* than even
the software that is produced. The end result is that a certain bar needs to
be raised to ensure that an ASF project will succeed. That it will have a
healthy community. If there is no code and no community, then there better
be a lot of trust in the (few) developers who are proposing such a beast :-)

mod_python obviously comes with a large user base and a vibrant community.
There are certainly no issues there. Mostly, I'm speaking to the concepts of
&quot;more Python stuff at the ASF.&quot;

[ and don't get me wrong; I'm a *huge* Python supporter; Google reports
  &quot;about 12,900&quot; pages for &quot;greg stein python&quot;  :-) ]

Cheers,
