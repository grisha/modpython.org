Wherever it ends up being hosted, I hope that these issues will be
resolved soon. I just got a bunch of messages from the list, some which
were sent back in July!

There can never be a thriving mod_python community if the basic means of
communication is cut off.

Without knowing anything about how the mod_python list server is set up,
I see no network problems with it. Connections to port 25 on the server
that is set up as MX for the domain modpython.org work just fine. So the
issue must be with the list software. Or perhaps the mail is transferred
to elsewhere and processed?

In any case, it would we nice if the list server admins could comment on
this. There are plenty of hands to use if help is needed, and there has
been an offer for a backup MX and a suggestion to use Sourceforge, which
should both be taken into consideration.

I'm don't want to offend anyone, but if the list will go on in this
shape, then perhaps the community should arrange for an alternative list
to use?

Cheers,
Fabian
