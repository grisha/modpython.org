Excellent.

I think everyone who has followed this thread knows my take on the
message to ASF so no more on that from me.

I would also be happy to see Grisha push this issue, but in
<A HREF="http://www.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2002-August/002372.html,">http://www.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2002-August/002372.html,</A>
he explains that he doesn't have time for this effort at the moment,
which I think should be respected. Therefore, as the initiator of this
thread, I feel compelled to do this instead.

I have made some progress but I urge you all to be patient. There really
isn't much use of everyone sending random mails all over the place. I'm
going to be in touch with several groups and individuals and as you
know, it takes a few days to get replies.

Rest assured that I'll post when there's something to tell.

&gt;<i> A good candidate to contact is David Welton of the mod_dtcl 
</I>&gt;<i> project. He can be contacted at <A HREF="http://mailman.modpython.org/mailman/listinfo/mod_python">davidw at apache.org.</A> Davis Welton is also a 
</I>&gt;<i> Python user, though I don't think he uses it for web.
</I>
Now this is the type of information I'm after. Many thanks for this
pointer - I shall contact David and ask for his views and advice.

Cheers,
Fabian
