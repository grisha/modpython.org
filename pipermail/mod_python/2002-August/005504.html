<PRE>Well, what a day to join the mod_python list!

I believe that mod_python needs to be more featured on the apache
website, just as mod_perl and PHP.  As a developer who has worked with
perl for quite sometime, I have run into perl's limitations in a large
scale applications.  I began to seek out other choices that offered both
performance and a strong OO base from which management of large scale
applications.  I had looked at python before, but didn't know of
mod_python - and running something in the CGI space is sooo 1996 =D

Though another project I came to find mailman, and though the mailman
docs I came to find out about mod_python.  Mailman IMHO is a strong
reason why python can compete as a &quot;web language&quot;, offering the OO of
Java without the performance hit or running a separate server just for
Java (ala Tomcat).

I also think mod_python will begin to gain a larger following as Apache
2.0 is deployed.  Python just strikes me as a much better language to
fit in with the new format and concepts of the Apache 2.0 modules.

Perl, Python, and PHP each have their own strengths and faults when used
under Apache.  Not one of them will ever replace the need for the other,
and I hope they never try to.  Different application have different
goals and require different approaches.  I feel all warm and fuzzy
inside thinking about how the open source community has provided me with
a solution for every need.  Python is one of those solutions, and every
bit as worthy of python.apache.org as the rest.

Subject: [mod_python] Promoting Python as web application development
language


Hello, World!

In a recent thread [0] on the mod_python [1] mailing list, I'm wondering
why there isn't a Python link on the main Apache web site. There are
PHP, Perl and Tcl links but Python is nowhere present.

It is of course evident that the lack of a link is due to the lack of
perceived usage of Python as a web application development language.
That, in turn, is due to the lack of exposure on sites like the Apache
one.

I would like to see this change. Specifically, as I write in my post on
the mod_python mailing list,

    &quot;What I would like to do is get a link to the mod_python web site
    under the &quot;Sister Projects&quot; section of <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/,">http://www.apache.org/,</A> or
    (preferably) find out how a python.apache.org could be created,
    either as a general Python-Apache site or as a direct link to the
    mod_python web site (perl.apache.org is actually the mod_perl
    site).&quot;
    
I have concluded that before any such thing can be done, the opinions of
the people currently using the Python-Apache combination (which I
suspect is no small number) need to be solicited to some degree.

I would like to hear what you think about the creation of a
&quot;python.apache.org&quot; (or equivalent) that would focus on the topic of web
app development with Python and Apache. I imagine the site itself being
quite slim with some essential information and links to other projects,
particularly to the mod_python site.

Also, I would like to hear about any related projects or any previous
contact to the Apache Software Foundation.


I apologise for the cross-post but I feel it is warranted in this case.
I'm only subscribed to the mod_python mailing list so please keep me or
that list Cc'ed if you reply.

Cheers,
Fabian Fagerholm
