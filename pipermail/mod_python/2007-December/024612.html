I'm guessing few people would even know what those changes are.

The unicode support thing ought to be simple - since it's
lacking right now, it just needs to be introduced right.
Of course, internally it's probably more complex.

I think it's going to be harder to keep mod_python together.
there is no benevolent dictator, so I fear things are just going
to get more complex (I already think m_p could stand a lot
of simplification - it's not something I'd suggest friends to use)
and sort of complexify itself out of relevance. Which is a pity.
