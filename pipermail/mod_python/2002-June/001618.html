How do you make other threads wait for editing on foo to finish?  By
busy-waiting?

Yes, that is the correct explanation.
 
&gt;<i> Is there a reliable way of handling such 'multi-user' persistent data under
</I>&gt;<i> Un*x, e.g multiple httpds pulling from the same Python? I'm guessing not :(
</I>
Not directly as far as I know.  In theory it might be possible using
Apache 2.0's MPM, though I'm not sure if it would be a good idea even
there.

The standard approach is to keep some kind of external shared storage
between the different children.  If you just need to share a single
hashtable, Python's 'shelve' library could be quite simple to use and
satisfactory.  Things based on some kind of shared-memory DB will not
necessarily be any slower than threads in a single memory space.

To make you feel better about this, there are some benefits to the
Unix approach:

 - it's more robust in the case where there's a bug that crashes 
    or hangs a single process child

 - on the whole I suspect you will be better able to execute concurrently 
   with multiple Python interpreters rather than a single image

 - you may have fewer concurrency bugs if data is private by default
   (separate processes) rather than shared by default (single image)

Cheers,
