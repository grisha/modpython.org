This is the reason I made a MP2WSGI "framework"
Which is in fact a MP code compatible MP adapter for MOD_WSGI

I run it in production but:

I have not yet got the util and PSP modules to work since there are some technical issues I have not found the time to solve.
This could very well be a solution for many MOD_PYTHON users.

(I stil need help on the parse_qs and parse_qsl functions for util to work)

I plan on integrating PSP too, contributors are welcome

The mod_python source code says that are C implementations of:

  cgi.parse_qs
  cgi.parse_qsl

Have how they work deviated over time?

Subject: [mod_python] Mac OS X compile issue (selecting python2.5)
Message-ID: <AANLkTikTJ_hkRPqL3Y_gFmcHDrgQq1QqVCh54-4oLi-n@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a python web application which requires python2.5.  I am attempting
to compile mod_python on Snow Leopard against the OS apache and the OS
python2.5.  The steps I have taken are as follows:

1. checked out mod_python from svn

  $ svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/quetzalcoatl/mod_python/trunkmod_python-svn

2. configured mod_python to use the Snow Leopard Apache and the Snow Leopard
python2.5

  $ cd mod_python-svn
  $ ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs --with-python=/usr/bin/python2.5

3. built mod_python

  $ make

The resulting mod_python.so is linked against the 2.6 framework:

  $ otool -L src/mod_python.so
  src/mod_python.so:
/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version
125.0.1)
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Python
(compatibility version 2.6.0, current version 2.6.1)

This is essentially broken for my purposes.  If I continue the process and
install, it becomes apparent that mod_python is indeed running the 2.6
interpreter and my application does not run.  I have seen some conversation
about this issue, but those conversations did not appear productive.

Is 2.5 simply not supported?  Is this a known bug on mac os x?  Are there
any suggestions for remedying the situation?

Best,

Patrick

So to get things started on util.py you say that I can use the cgi module for those functions?
I found them in the cgi module before but dcumentation on these functions in MP is sparse/non existant

I did not dare to start using them, I'll have a look at the cgi versions to see if things on util.py in MP2WSGI can be speeded up with that.

I'm not familiar with using C for python extentions but might end up using the MP code "if" possible but I see some difficulties in doing so.

This is exactly the outstanding problem I mention in relation to MacOS X in:

  http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2010/05/modpython-project-soon-to-be-officially.html

The question at this point is why must you use mod_python?

After posting the bug I discovered your blog post, and have begun the
process of switching to mod_wsgi :-)

Subject: [mod_python] package importing
Message-ID: <4C2328AE.4010008@elabor.biz>

Hello,

I'm exploring mod_python and I'm having trouble with the package importing.

I've a structure like this:

 <my base dir>
   |
   +- __init__.py
   +- index.py
   +- package (directory)
       |
       +- __init__.py
       +- package.py (file)

and an Apache Virtual Host like this:


 <VirtualHost *:80>

        ServerAdmin root@localhost
        ServerName myname
        DocumentRoot /path/to/my base dir

        <Location />
                DirectoryIndex index.html index.py
                Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
                AddHandler mod_python .py
                PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
        </Location>

 </VirtualHost>

in the index.py file I've something like this:

    from package.package import myobject
    ....
    ....

When I load index.py from Apache, I get a 500 Internal Server Error as
follows:

    ImportError: No module named package.package

What am I doing wrong?

Cheers,
Ivan

You might want to post this question on StackOverflow.com.  There are many Python experts there, also.

Subject: [mod_python] My .py won't some up for the blient
Message-ID: <AANLkTimWBQ_JUwPoAIIC1VIpiJpilrpTwtIUrW7cVwOb@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Newbie question. I was hoping to have template HTML at the beginning
of my .py script and the end. I can't get it to work. Here is what I
have.

destroy_confirm.py =

import HTML_template
HTML_template.start()
'''\
  <center>
  <table width = 550 cellpadding = 10 bgcolor=white>
    <tr><td><center>This action will delete all your session files.
    <tr><td><center>
        <form  action="destroy_LogOut.psp" method="">
        <center><input type="submit" value="Run MolProbity Compare"></center>'''
HTML_template.end()


HTML_template.py =

def start():
    start= '''\
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <center>
  <table width = 1024 cellpadding = 10>
    <tr><td valign = top>Molprobity Compare<br /><br /><br />
                    <a href ="destroy_confirm.psp">Log Off</a>
        <td>
            <table width = 850 cellpadding = 10>
                <tr><td colspan = 2><center><h1>MolProbity Compare</h1></center>
                <tr><td colspan = 2>Molprbity Compare will allow you
to compare Molprobity parameters
                    for two different structures. The program will
highlghit important
                    differences between the two.
            </table>
  <hr>
'''
    return start

def end():
    end = '''\
  </table>
  </center>
</body>
</html>
'''
    return end


Handlers in httpd.conf  =

<Directory /Library/WebServer/Documents>
    AddHandler mod_python .py .psp .psp_
    <FilesMatch "\.(psp|psp_)$">
	PythonHandler mod_python.psp
	</FilesMatch>
	<Files *.py>
	PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
	</Files>
    PythonDebug On
</Directory>

I hope this isn't too much to ask.  Any ideas?

Ok. I re-wrote my destroy_confirm.py script and got the right output
to the client but it seems my styl sheets don't work. when I take the
exact string that I'm returning and save it in an HTML file the style
sheets work. Any ideas why my .py script won't implement my css?

Here is my new destroy_confirm.py;

import HTML_template

def middle():

    mid='''\
<center>
<table width = 550 cellpadding = 10 bgcolor=white>
<tr><td><center>This action will delete all your session files.
<tr><td><center>
<form  action="destroy_LogOut.psp" method="">
<center><input type="submit" value="Run MolProbity Compare"></center>'''

    return mid

def show():
    html_all = HTML_template.start() + middle() + HTML_template.end()
    return html_all



Thanks,
Bradley

Hello,

I fixed my problem reconfiguring the VirtualHost using properly the
PythonPath directive (see here:
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-3.1.2b/doc-html/dir-other-pp.html
):

<VirtualHost *:80>
       	ServerAdmin root@localhost
        ServerName mydomain.com

        PythonPath "sys.path+['/path/to/mybasedir']"
       	Alias / /path/to/mybasedir

        <Location />
       	        DirectoryIndex index.html index.py
               	AddHandler mod_python .py
                PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
                PythonDebug On
       	</Location>

</VirtualHost>

Cheers, :)
Ivan
