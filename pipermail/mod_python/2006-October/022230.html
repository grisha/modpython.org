It's probably hard not to reinvent the wheel when what you want is 
something as trivial as a telnet web application frontend, um, thingy. 
I want it to be small, lightweight, and specifically adapted for my needs, 
that is the sole reason why I am doing it.

&gt;<i> Back to your threads. The problem with using Apache/mod_python when

</I>&gt;<i> processes. This is because when using prefork or worker Apache MPMs

</I>&gt;<i> telnet connection, when a subsequent request arrives and it ends up being

</I>&gt;<i> the open connection. On Win32 boxes this isn't a problem, as there is only one
</I>&gt;<i> Apache process and all requests are handled by it.
</I>
Thank you for this clarification. I could not find that information 
anywhere although I was desparately looking for it. All I found was 
persistence this and persistence that and I noticed that there was 
no real persistence at all (at least the way I understand it).

Unless I missed the explanation somewhere, maybe this should go to 
some obvious place like the FAQ?

&gt;<i> Also, even if there were some way, Apache is allowed to shutdown 
</I>&gt;<i> specific child processes at any time, so you would loose any open 
</I>&gt;<i> connection anyway.
</I>
Especially this part is worth mentioning. Thanks. So there really 
is no way but to use some daemon independent from Apache.

Thanks for all the replies. :-)

Although that means I will need to write a daemon for almost anything 
that needs persistence (databases don't except for performance reasons).
