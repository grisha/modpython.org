</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I think perhaps your first problem is that assumption of triviality. I 
find it's more useful to describe a problem as trivial after I have 
solved it with less than ten lines of code. Until then I'd prefer to 
describe the level of difficulty as &quot;unknown&quot;.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Back to your threads. The problem with using Apache/mod_python when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you want to preserve some state between requests is not threads but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>processes. This is because when using prefork or worker Apache MPMs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>on UNIX systems, subsequent requests can be directed to different Apache
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>child processes. As a result, if one child process had initiated a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>telnet connection, when a subsequent request arrives and it ends up being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>processed by a different child process, it will not have access to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the open connection. On Win32 boxes this isn't a problem, as there is only one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Apache process and all requests are handled by it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for this clarification. I could not find that information 
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere although I was desparately looking for it. All I found was 
</I>&gt;<i> persistence this and persistence that and I noticed that there was 
</I>&gt;<i> no real persistence at all (at least the way I understand it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unless I missed the explanation somewhere, maybe this should go to 
</I>&gt;<i> some obvious place like the FAQ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>It's a fairly usual condition in web systems: the persistence referred 
to is usually persistence of session state data rather than persistence 
of process and network connection state.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Also, even if there were some way, Apache is allowed to shutdown 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>specific child processes at any time, so you would loose any open 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>connection anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially this part is worth mentioning. Thanks. So there really 
</I>&gt;<i> is no way but to use some daemon independent from Apache.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Correct.

&gt;<i> Thanks for all the replies. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although that means I will need to write a daemon for almost anything 
</I>&gt;<i> that needs persistence (databases don't except for performance reasons).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>If you want to persist a network connection across multiple web client 
interactions then you have indeed summed up your situation quite succinctly.
