If you are writing some new services, does it matter what MS uses for 
there own?
If you are having to write clients against MS web services then I can 
understand
the need to talk SOAP, but other than that SOAP wouldn't be my first 
choice, or
my second, or my third, ....

Hmmm, I have never seen the words &quot;easily/conveniently&quot; mentioned in 
conjunction
with SOAP before. I also wouldn't assume that just because you publish 
a SOAP
API that someone will go to the effort of specially writing clients to 
use it.
The only SOAP API I have seen really take off in that way was Google 
search.

</I>
Sounds just like SOAP. :-)

Sorry if I sound cynical. You might find the following an interesting 
read:

Reminded me that the other alternative to SOAP/XML-RPC is REST style 
web services.
