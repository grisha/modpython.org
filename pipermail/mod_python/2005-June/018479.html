Certain input data. What's different about the data is it fails certain 
error checking tests.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have a development server for it that queries the same MySQL and

</I>
It hangs at the same point on both the development server and the 
production server.

&gt;&gt;<i> When I don't have a Session defined, it hangs up at a section that is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a call to an API that inserts some data in a MySQL server
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a call to psp.redirect (which should throw an error because i've 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already returned stuff to the client, but it doesn't throw an error)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does psp.redirect get called or are you saying it hangs before it 
</I>&gt;<i> reaches the redirect?. The beauty of python is you can jump right it 
</I>&gt;<i> and change it. Stick a self.req.log_error() into the psp.redirect 
</I>&gt;<i> method in psp.py and make sure it actually reaches that point if you 
</I>&gt;<i> are in doubt.
</I>
I believe it is getting the the psp.redirect and hanging. As I said in 
my other post, it hangs at a different point when I enter form data 
that is bad in another way and a psp.redirect is being called.

&gt;&gt;<i> Trying that API from command line by hand works like a charm, so I'm 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not convinced it's the API.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When I do have a Session defined, it hangs up on trying to import the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Import the session or create the session? ie
</I>&gt;<i> import Session
</I>&gt;<i>    vs.
</I>&gt;<i> sess = Session.DbmSession(req)
</I>
class BSISession(Session.DbmSession):
     def __getitem__(self, key):
         try:
             return super(BSISession, self).__getitem__(key)
         except KeyError:
             return ''

It hangs on:

sess=SignupLib.BSISession(req)

The session is not new at this point, so it's reading it from the DBM 
file.

&gt;<i> If you mean creating the session, it sounds like a deadlock issue. 
</I>&gt;<i> There are known problems when using sessions in conjunction with psp 
</I>&gt;<i> pages, where you create a session before calling a psp page which 
</I>&gt;<i> contains a variable named 'session'. You'll need to manually save and 
</I>&gt;<i> unlock the session before calling the psp run method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are on Windows there is a double whammy if you are trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> use DbmSession in your handler code. The psp code will try to create a 
</I>&gt;<i> new session instance but using MemorySession instead of DbmSession. 
</I>&gt;<i> (It's not really Windows specific, it just that the default apache mpm 
</I>&gt;<i> on Windows is threaded and so MemorySession is selected as the 
</I>&gt;<i> default. And, it's is not actually a deadlock issue, but it will make 
</I>&gt;<i> it appear like your session data is getting lost.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Apache on Linux.

&gt;<i> These issues will be fixed in the soon to be released (we all hope) 
</I>&gt;<i> version 3.2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've got a wrapper around the Session,DbmSession class which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basically does nothing but return an empty string instead of raising 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an error if a key doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So could this be masking some important information if an exception is 
</I>&gt;<i> being raised?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My code is above... I think it's unlikely, but you tell me...

&gt;&gt;<i> I've already cleared the dbm file, started over from scratch, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ensured that the dbm file is readable/writable by apache.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I cleared the semaphore array for Apache, I've restarted Apache, I've 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restarted MySQL, and none of it has helped...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anybody have any ideas? I'm just stumped at this point. If you need 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code snippets or the site to test it out on, let me know. Thanks!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry I couldn't really help, but at least there a few more things for 
</I>&gt;<i> you to think about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I appreciate the feedback... but I'm afraid I'm still stuck... :-/
