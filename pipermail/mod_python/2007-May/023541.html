To say ldap is only referring to the auth provider, not what HTTP
authentication mechanism is being used. Two that Apache understands
are Basic and Digest.

&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that the way you are doing it is more or less

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is what I was afraid of.  Note that don't actually want to

</I>&gt;<i> path I want to see if the supplied credentials are valid for a different
</I>&gt;<i> path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only way I could conceive of you being able to do it then would be

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept of user roles whereby user who hasn't logged in through web

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; called as Python objects would check what role session has and reject
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; call if not required rights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason cookies won't work is that the REST path (/api/....) is REST.
</I>&gt;<i>  It doesn't give out cookies, or rather wouldn't make sense to.  It
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be accessed directly from a browser but rather from various
</I>&gt;<i> other standalone programs.  The browser would access the web admin which
</I>&gt;<i> behind the scenes calls the apis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really want to make this easy for the administrator and Apache has a
</I>&gt;<i> fine way of expressing access control.  If they say that only members of
</I>&gt;<i> a certain ldap group can delete objects (by accessing
</I>&gt;<i> /api/objectname/delete) then I want the separate web admin code to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically obey that.  I really don't want to have to build in a
</I>&gt;<i> second set of access controls, roles etc to the web admin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked over all the APIs twice and can't see any way that that a
</I>&gt;<i> request on one path can do anything with other paths such as retrieve
</I>&gt;<i> their content.  I guess my last recourse is to use urllib2 with
</I>&gt;<i> request.construct_url() and copy headers across hoping for the best.  It
</I>&gt;<i> will work fine with basic style authentication but won't for NTLM and
</I>&gt;<i> similar challenge response ones.
</I>
Except that that will not work. The problem is that AuthType and
AuthName wouldn't be set for /admin if you only use them on /api, so
the web browser wouldn't normally even send the authentication
information through for /admin URL. Thus there isn't going to be any
auth information to pass through to a sub request.

BTW, looking at Apache APIs the call that may have allowed you to do
subrequests and incorporate output within a parent page is:

  ap_run_sub_req()

Even if exposed in mod_python it would still not help given that you
wouldn't have the auth information available for /admin URL to pass
through.
