Interesting. Have you looked at how normpath() and normcase() work?
I've not seen that used before - does windows behave 'correctly' wrt
case sensitivity? (i.e. rejecting paths which are case incorrect)?

&gt;<i> Probably the safest thing is to open the file and ask whether it's the same file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same question then would apply to unix/linux systems, would you want the module loaded as

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all of that - i think it's reasonable to require the same module to be spelled the same way.

import already uses 'normpath()' so that paths do not have to be
identical. There is a cryptic comment in the os.path docs about
symlinks, too: &quot;It should be understood that this may change the
meaning of the path if it contains symbolic links!&quot;, so I suspect that
this can of worms is already open (maybe entirely wrong - I don't know
enough about the subtleties of normpath/normcase).

normcase() could also be used just to produce the label used to key
the module within the cache, rather than performing the lookup / file
operations on a case-munged path. Thus file-system interraction (e.g.
using a case-sensitive file system where normcase doesn't expect it).

e.g.    label = self._module_label(os.path.normcase(file))

This use of normcase() would only &quot;break&quot; things if you were loading
modules from two paths which differed only by case (after a normpath()
operation, I think?) on an OS which is (normally) case insensitive,
which is a fairly pathological and ill-advised thing to be doing.

Having just looked at the code, all the os.path stuff is specific to
operating system - posix / NT / mac. I would assume that these
behaviours are also embedded pretty deeply elsewhere in python.

I'm just a little wary about having import_path silently deviate from
its stated behaviour (&quot;distinguishing modules by location&quot;). I was
watching imports carefully so spotted it, but I would imagine most
people would struggle to understand why &quot;~/mymodule&quot; and
&quot;c:\mypath\mymodule&quot; was causing the module to be loaded twice even
though it's in the same location.

Cheers
