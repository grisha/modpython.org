The code took two parameters and so it was a (wrong) educated guess as
to what they were :-)

That is a pity.  I was hoping to use it as part of my automated testing.

3.2.10 wasn't released that long ago.  It is the default one supplied
with Feisty which went into freeze a few months ago (ie before 3.3.1 was
released).  If 3.3.1 was guaranteed bug free at release etc then I'm
sure they could have sneaked it in, but I doubt it or any other software
can make those guarantees :-)

That is pretty much the problem.  I ultimately solved all the issues by
writing a decorator for my handlers that checks return codes (I got
bitten a few times forgetting to return OK or DECLINED), sets the
correct codes, prints stack traces with variables (see
<A HREF="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52215">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52215</A> ) etc.

&gt;<i> For the status line message the answer is no. Why would you want to
</I>&gt;<i> change the message from the normal one anyway?
</I>
So I can use it in my testing.  The status line is intended to be
targeted at machines and hence can be terse.  The body is longer winded
and targeted at people.  (Sure it can be done either way but it was just
something I hoped to be able to do).
