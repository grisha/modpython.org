Entirely up to the administrator, but most likely ldap.

That is what I was afraid of.  Note that don't actually want to
circumvent the authentication at all - it is just that in code for one
path I want to see if the supplied credentials are valid for a different
path.

&gt;<i> The only way I could conceive of you being able to do it then would be

</I>
The reason cookies won't work is that the REST path (/api/....) is REST.
 It doesn't give out cookies, or rather wouldn't make sense to.  It
wouldn't be accessed directly from a browser but rather from various
other standalone programs.  The browser would access the web admin which
behind the scenes calls the apis.

I really want to make this easy for the administrator and Apache has a
fine way of expressing access control.  If they say that only members of
a certain ldap group can delete objects (by accessing
/api/objectname/delete) then I want the separate web admin code to
automatically obey that.  I really don't want to have to build in a
second set of access controls, roles etc to the web admin.

I've looked over all the APIs twice and can't see any way that that a
request on one path can do anything with other paths such as retrieve
their content.  I guess my last recourse is to use urllib2 with
request.construct_url() and copy headers across hoping for the best.  It
will work fine with basic style authentication but won't for NTLM and
similar challenge response ones.
