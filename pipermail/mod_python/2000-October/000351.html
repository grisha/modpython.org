I would count it as dynamic data that can be lost. I am thinking this thing
would be great as a cache mainly for expensive database lookups, caching files
into memory for faster loading.

</I>&gt;<i> I see Apache (and mod_python, which is just an interface to it) as a

</I>&gt;<i> function to a database. 
</I>
Data storage no, caching yes.

 
&gt;<i> If you think about it carefully, there is a slew of issues one has to

</I>
There are a lot of issues, however squeezing some more performance out of
my application by caching files and the like would be extremely useful.
 
The question is the implemenation, afaict apache does not have a global shared
memroy by default, although there seems to be optional patches that can be
compiled in to give you access to to this memory, from what I can tell if we
had access to this interface it would be possible to create a global dictionary
in mod_python to suppport this. Is it worth creating extensions to mod_python
which rely on patches to the apache core?

If anyone with more apache experience than i have could make any comments I would
appreciate it.
