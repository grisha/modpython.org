My impression from the description of the Py_SetProgramName() function
was that it provided not so much of a hard-coding to the path but rather
steering the search for the executable to first look at a specific
location before looking in other likely places.

Has that been your experience in using Py_SetProgramName()?

</I>
Apparently, the use of PYTHONHOME would still override the value given
to Py_SetProgramName(), so it doesn't seem to me that you would lose any 
flexibility by its use.

&gt;<i> This still didn't work for Windows, but seemed the best

</I>&gt;<i> configuration file was that that mechanism could then be used to point

</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/VirtualEnvironments">http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/VirtualEnvironments</A>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which for mod_wsgi talks about the same problem with wrong version of

</I>
One reason for my terseness in my original post was that I couldn't see
any reason (at the time) for not employing Py_SetProgramName(), since it
seemed to me to be the preferred mechanism (if the executable path is
known at compile time) to *correctly* specify the path for a package 
maintainer whose work will end up on other people's systems.  Or to give a 
person like myself (targeting a specialized type of installation) to use 
a symlink that actually points to the desired interpreter, without the
need to define PYTHONHOME (that has complicated things in the past
here).

Anyway, thank you for you attention.
