No you didn't, it came with the operating system.

Removing the OS supplied Python is a really bad idea and you may now
have potentially broken parts of your operating system that depend on
it. Unless you can copy back the bits you deleted from another copy of
same OS, you may have to reinstall the OS.

In short, on MacOS X, you should never delete anything under
/System/Library as this is the operating system area. Any user code
packages should get installed under /Library if it did so and only
really safe to remove stuff out of there, but only if again you have
also removed any dependencies.

After you have fixed your OS, personally I would suggest that since
you are new to Python not to bother with mod_python initially.
Instead, learn one of higher level frameworks such as Django or
Pylons. These can be run with their own internal Python web servers.
At lowest level they use WSGI which allows them to be deployed to
various web hosting solutions if you ever get as far as a production
system.

So, first step is to get Python 2.3 working again. After that I'd even
suggest you get rid of Python 2.5 and just use Python 2.3 for the time
being. If learning Python you aren't going to miss much by doing this.

&gt;<i> Other than that, I'm impressed at how easy this has been so far :) Python
</I>&gt;<i> looks great, and mod_python has some features that PHP just cant compete on
</I>&gt;<i> (creating custom apache filters in python? sweet!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, and on top of all this, I suppose I should learn python itself :) Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> recommend any good books? I hear that the O'Rielly Programming Python book
</I>&gt;<i> is great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your help, in advance!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
