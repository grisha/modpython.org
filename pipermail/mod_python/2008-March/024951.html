<PRE>Hi guys and gals,

Quick progress update:

I Googled about and found this article:

<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/django-users@googlegroups.com/msg38088.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/django-users@googlegroups.com/msg38088.html</A>

I noticed that it made reference to the correct 2.5 library framework, so I
recompiled mod_python with the following set of instructions:

$ export
LDFLAGS=-Wl,-F/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/
$ ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
--with-python=/usr/local/bin/python
$ make
$ sudo make install

Restarted Apache, and got the following message again:

Cannot load /usr/local/apache2/modules/mod_python.so into server: Library
not loaded:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/Python\n
Referenced from: /usr/local/apache2/modules/mod_python.so\n  Reason: image
not found

Again, it still references 2.3. So there must still be some obscure
reference somewhere, pointing the configure script to the older framework
version.

Any OSX/Unix jedi's out there that shed some light on this, or any
suggestions on locations I should be looking for this reference?

I'd just like to add to Cindys previous comment that I too have had nothing
but positive experiences with OSX, and it certainly has eased the &quot;fear&quot; of
Unix/Linux systems for me. However, it is my understanding that mod_python
is relatively new (I not sure if this truely is the case, but it certainly
is the image projected), and that whilst it works and is production ready,
it's not in the PHP/Ruby+Rails click-click-click install phase just yet.
Personally, I understood that using mod_python would require that I roll my
sleeves up and get elbow deep in the terminal, but then I'm personally
having a whale of a time trying to sort this out and get it working on OSX.
But maybe thats just me :)

anyways, I'll keep poking away at this and posting my results!

Cheers!

Ben

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.3  The installs went ok.  BUt I was never able to use Django,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since it depended on mysql, and the mysqldb failed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problems I was having were the same.  I never got the answers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as to where/what  path vars needed to be set, any init files, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so that the ensemble of python, mysql, and django would orchestrate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2.5 has the advantage of having sqlite in it.   If I was going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do it again, starting with Django, I'd have tried to find someone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who had gone through installing on OSX before.   It seems such a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let down to think this is such a great language, and then not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to get it installed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that on linix boxes, this is not a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since OSX is the best machine environment I have ever used in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; life, and I have installed dozens of other languages, tools, sw,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on this and other platforms, I would have to conclude that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; install of the Django setup on OSX requires in-depth sys admin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knowledge that is not in the documentation...  hitting a landmine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like you did is unacceptable to me as a user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This kind of situation costs our country and each of us HUGE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amounts of wasted time.   Viruses are bad enough.  But the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it takes to recover from such problems is wasted time that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could have been doing something productive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's my two cents.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Remember, you can always fall back on perl.   That will still work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cindy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ps.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do plan to try python in the future, but only if someone else
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who knows how to do it, and has done it, sets the system up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Its a MAJOR process on OSX apparently.
