Hello everyone

I know there are a couple of topics about this matter already, however I
didn't find the required information yet...

Currently I'm using the publisher handler to generate some html websites
with apache user authentification (just one group of users with an
AuthUserFile) and a very simple session management (just save some state
variables for my python scripts).

What I intend to do now is:

1. have several _groups_ of users with different access rights, for
example:

Group A: user1, user2, user3 --&gt; have access to function1 and function3
(in my publisher-handler python scripts)
GroupB: user4, user5 --&gt; have access to function2

2. the user-accounts (ID &amp; PW) should be maintainable in an easy way
(something like the auth-file from apache) 3. the userID (stored in the
file?) should be available for my python scripts / session (so I can
display them etc) 4. the session (-obj) should be able to create a new
folder for each session (=user) and delete that folder again when the
session ends

I know that mod_python has some sort of auth-handlers, however, I don't
know how to combine an auth-handler with my publisher-handler? For
example, how can an auth-handler pass the user/session data to the
publisher handler? And is it possible for the mod_python session
mechanism to create/delete temp-folders etc? Or is there maybe another
python module, which would be better for that purpose?

I'm sure that I'm not the first one who needs to do such stuff :-P. So
it would be cool if someone had an example (or link to a good tutorial)
for me as the mod_python user manual is pretty short imo (to short for
me to really understand it tbh).

Thanks in advance

Dominique
