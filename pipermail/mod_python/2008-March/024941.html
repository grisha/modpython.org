<PRE>Hello everyone!

I've been convinced by reading the mod_python manual that python may well be
the language for me, moving away from PHP5 with all it's sillyness. I've
also decided that if I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do this properly; that
means downloading the source for Apache 2.2.8, mod_python 3.3.1 and
compiling this myself. I should learn all this anyway, so why not now? As
you may have already guessed, I've hit a snag.

I'm attempting to run all this on my 1.83Gh Intel Core Duo Macbook, on OSX
10.4.11. I followed the instructions described at the following address:

<A HREF="http://blog.minus-zero.org/post/apache-22-and-mod-python-on-os-x">http://blog.minus-zero.org/post/apache-22-and-mod-python-on-os-x</A>

So, how did I do? Well, I got Apache up and running: everything seems
tickety-boo there. I downloaded the python installed (v2.5.2) and installed
that okay: fired up bash and ran python, and everything seems fine there. I
compiled mod_python, and everything seemed okay.

I tried to restart apache by I get the following error message generated by
apache:

Cannot load /usr/local/apache2/modules/mod_python.so into server: Library
not loaded:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/Python\n
Referenced from: /usr/local/apache2/modules/mod_python.so\n  Reason: image
not found

I double checked the message spewed out when configure and make ran for
mod_python, and all the messages that refer to frameworks specify version
2.5, as I would expect. No mention of 2.3 anywhere. It appears to me that
mod_python.so was compiled against a framework that supposedly resides in
the system/library/frameworks folder that doesn't exist. Now, I had previous
problems, and I think I may have had a previous version of python installed
(2.3 I think) but I've looked about and I believe I had deleted all
references to it. Now when I reinstall python (2.5), I get an error saying
that the installation failed, yet python appears to work correctly! I have a
suspicion that my poking about has buggered things, proper like.

It was my understanding that the python installer would have upgraded 2.3 to
2.5, along with any references to 2.3. But for some reason, mod_python is
trying to link to this missing 2.3 framework, even though 2.5 is in the
/Library/Frameworks folder, where I believe it should be! Wha!

Can anyone help me? I've been fiddling about with this mess for about 48
hours now and I'm so close to getting this working I can taste it! Heres a
quick summary:

- I may have installed python 2.3 in the past
- I installed python 2.5, but it appears that it did not replace all the
references to 2.3, because
- apache/mod_python complains about a missing 2.3 framework, which
- I, in a spate of backspace frenzies, deleted, thinking I wouldn't need it,
cos I have 2.5 installed, which has its own framework files located
elsewhere

Other than that, I'm impressed at how easy this has been so far :) Python
looks great, and mod_python has some features that PHP just cant compete on
(creating custom apache filters in python? sweet!)

Oh, and on top of all this, I suppose I should learn python itself :) Anyone
recommend any good books? I hear that the O'Rielly Programming Python book
is great.

Thanks for your help, in advance!

Cheers,

Ben
