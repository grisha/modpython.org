So you just wrote to complain?  No help, no recommendations?  Just fix 
stuff so it runs on the platform you like?

Since thousands of Linux users around the world have no problem with 
these set ups, I would think the problem lies in OS X.  I like it too, 
but I don't use it for software development.  Maybe you should be 
complaining to Apple and not the Open Source community.

I think you accurately summarize your view on the matter in your post 
script.  You expect someone else to do it for you.
