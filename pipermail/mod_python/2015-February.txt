Subject: [mod_python] Observing issue in mod_python.publisher on ARM 64 bit
	machine
Message-ID: <be0d1fcdcc9c4ccfb835256d098f7c95@GURMBXV01.AD.ARICENT.COM>

Hi,

We are using the following configurations on ARM 64 bit machine

Apache Version:- 2.4.10
Python Version:- 2.7.4
Mod_Python:- 3.5.0

And we are observing the following error in mod_python.publisher while running our application

Mod_python error: "PythonHandler mod_python.publisher"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mod_python/apache.py", line 421, in HandlerDispatch
    result = obj(req)
  File "/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mod_python/publisher.py", line 128, in handler
    path,module_name =  os.path.split(req.filename)
  File "/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/posixpath.py", line 92, in split
    i = p.rfind('/') + 1
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'rfind'

However, mod_python.testhandler is working fine and its output is showing mod_python.publisher as available.

Apache version

Apache/2.4.10 (Unix)

Apache threaded MPM

Yes, maximum 25 threads / process

Apache forked MPM

Yes, maximum 16 processes

Apache server root

/etc/apache2

Apache document root

/opt/ems/gui

Apache error log

/var/apache2/logs/error_log (view last 100 lines<https://10.3.10.228/python/framework/ems_session_mgmt.py/ems_recv_n_verify_user_name?view_log=1>)

Python sys.version

2.7.4 (default, Feb 11 2015, 10:04:28) [GCC 4.9.3 20141031 (prerelease)]

Python sys.path


/opt/ems/gui/python

/opt/ems/gui/python/common

/opt/ems/gui/python/framework/

/usr/bin/lib/python27.zip

/usr/bin/lib/python2.7

/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2

/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/lib-tk

/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/lib-old

/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload

/usr/bin/lib/python2.7/site-packages

Python interpreter name

www.example.com<http://www.example.com>

mod_python.publisher available

Yes

mod_python.psp available

Yes


I came across the following link wherein it has suggested to make "_server" and "_interpreter" as public. I tried but it didn't work.
http://osdir.com/ml/apache.mod-python.devel/2006-03/msg00250.html/


Do we have to use any particular version of Apache or Python on ARM 64 bit server or are we missing on any step in our current set-up? Please suggest

Note:- We also tried with another version of mod_python(i.e. 3.4.1)

Regards
Amit Mehra

Somehow your req.filename is None. This is probably something with your
Apache configuration, I can't see it being ARM-specific.
