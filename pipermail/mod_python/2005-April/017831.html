&gt;<i> btw, everyone, I also posted a quick and dirty mod_python status page to

</I>&gt;<i> page, this is the same idea..

URL for the FAQ challenged is:

  <A HREF="http://www.modpython.org/FAQ/faqw.py?req=show&amp;file=faq03.019.htp">http://www.modpython.org/FAQ/faqw.py?req=show&amp;file=faq03.019.htp</A>

I also have one but not currently as extensive as your one as far as
details displayed as I didn't want to be revealing important stuff about
my site given that I have it up as a live example.

  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/examples/utilities/request-details.html">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/examples/utilities/request-details.html</A>

Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't be posting that, as it currently shows that
my site is held together with string and proxy redirects while I move
to my new site. :-(

The code for various utilities I provide with Vampire can be seen online
by browsing:

  <A HREF="http://svn.dscpl.com.au/vampire/trunk/examples/utilities/">http://svn.dscpl.com.au/vampire/trunk/examples/utilities/</A>

Unfortuately, SVN doesn't seem to set &quot;text/plain&quot; content type and
browser thus don't show you the actual source code properly. :-(

To see it properly can also go:

  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/request-details.html">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/request-details.html</A>
  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/request-details.py">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/request-details.py</A>
  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/form-values.html">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/form-values.html</A>
  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/request-details.py">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/examples/utilities/request-details.py</A>

This is using a special handler which allows you to source the active
source code used to render my own site.

  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/source.py">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/source/source.py</A>

Since the Vampire source package is also my actual web site for the
package, no too hard to work out what to stick after &quot;source&quot; in that
URL and you can see most stuff with it being nicely formatted.
  
&gt;<i> Can you do an announcement on the list of vampyre with the features and
</I>&gt;<i> how easy it is to install? (Is it in Debian by any chance? Does it
</I>&gt;<i> require Python 2.something?)
</I>
Vampire has been announced on the list at each release. The site is:

  <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire</A>

A quick overview is:

    <A HREF="http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/articles/vampire-001.html">http://www.dscpl.com.au/projects/vampire/articles/vampire-001.html</A>

The last release (1.5), will work with Python 2.3 and later. It is supposed to
work with Python 2.2 but I used a feature was only introduced in Python 2.3.
The version in the source repository works with Python 2.2 though.

Vampire should work with both mod_python 2.7.X or 3.X. Ie., you can still
use Apache 1.3 and older mod_python. A good thing about this is that the
drop in replacement for publisher works the same on old and new mod_python
where that supplied with mod_python doesn't.

It is provided with a standard distutils &quot;setup.py&quot; file form installation. Sorry,
no RPMs, although if you have the tools you can possibly create one using
the distutils &quot;setup.py&quot; file.
