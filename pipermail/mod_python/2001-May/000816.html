This is the danger of the JavaServer/PHP approach, not been aware of this.

Again, the tools they are using gives them this impression, or at least support
there view of the world. And then we have the same problem with ex. ASP as we
have with RAD tools --- the level of insight and experience.

&gt;<i> As for multiple-server user sessions, there are some solutions available in

</I>&gt;<i> (ugh :-) or a solution along the lines of Java's RMI to keep the session

</I>
Or even a CORBA version to keep the real-time aspect :-)

&gt;<i> You might want to check out WebWare (webware.sourceforge.net) as an expample
</I>&gt;<i> web framework that has some session support.  I think they pickle objects to
</I>&gt;<i> the file system.  There are some other python-based cgi frameworks that also
</I>&gt;<i> support user sessions, but just be aware of how far such solutions will/will
</I>&gt;<i> not take you.
</I>
I would be nervous about the performance and the real-time aspect by using the
file system approach, but thanks for the advise, I will look into it.
