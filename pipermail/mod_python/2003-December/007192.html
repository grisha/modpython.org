&gt;<i> Don't reinvent the wheel. Building your own CMS is not a good idea 
</I>&gt;<i> unless none of the existing &quot;CMS type&quot; web frameworks do what you need - 
</I>&gt;<i> which would be very surprising as there are dozens of them for both PHP 
</I>&gt;<i> and Python; do a bit of research and pick one that suits your needs 
</I>&gt;<i> best. For python, Zope is the largest and most difficult for someone 
</I>&gt;<i> coming from PHP world. There are also many alternatives to a full-blown 
</I>&gt;<i> CMS that you may find yourself more comfortable with, such as mod_python 
</I>&gt;<i> :-) Also be very careful when you see the word CMS used about a platform 
</I>&gt;<i> or product... it is used ultra-liberally in the industry.
</I>
I have looked at all the ones I know of but they all lack some of the features or
control I need.  I need to have a lot of users changing and editing content 
(text only) and it all goes to an editor.  All layout, graphics and photos need 
to be filtered through a different person.  Some types of content ie news needs to 
be approved by a vice president.  Zope can be extended to do all this but with
what I would need to do to extend it I might as customize it and write it
myself.  I do have a little experience with Python as I have written a POS
system in it.  The CMS I need will eventually even handle online registration as
I work for a Bible College.  I don't see it as reinventing the wheel I just 
don't like being tied down to a framework.  That is why I don't like Websphere
or J2ee.

&gt;<i> I have not tried the templating system being developed for mod_python; 
</I>&gt;<i> if you're considering mod_python, you should also try its native 
</I>&gt;<i> templating system.
</I>
What is mod_python's templating system?  Is it PSP.  I am trying to get PSP working
now and I cannot seem to get it to work.  I am using mod_python 3.01 with apache 2
on a RH9 box.  When I goto the page I just get the psp code?  :-s  Any ideas?
