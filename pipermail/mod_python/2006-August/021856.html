<PRE>&gt;<i> I presumed you added calls to apache.log_error() to confirm your
</I>&gt;<i> inithandler() was actually being called?
</I>
I added logs to the init handler and the main handler, and I also logged every 
__(get|set|del)(attr|item)__ and clear of instances of my shared space class. 
At every point I recorded the id()s of relevant objects, the current thread 
id, and the current contents of the space.

News just in: I've tried using the non-C version of threading.local, to be 
found in _threading_local.py, and it works fine. There is a performance hit 
apparently, but I'm not bashing it hard enough to notice any difference. This 
might point to some late night under-the-covers C shenanigans.

&gt;<i> Anyway, first off is that there are bugs in mod_python 3.1.4 related to the
</I>&gt;<i> creation of the Python interpreters and thread locking. I am not sure how
</I>&gt;<i> this would affect use of thread local storage, perhaps not depending on
</I>&gt;<i> where the data is held, but would definitely suggest you upgrade to 3.2.10.
</I>
There are no 3.2 ebuilds in Gentoo yet, so I'll hang on for the moment. I 
could upgrade by hand, but I have to be able to repeat this easily on other 
machines and I'm short on time. Sorry about that. I'll have a look at the 
change log and try not to whine too much about things that are fixed :-)

&gt;<i> This doesn't eliminate all module reloading problems, but gets rid of a few
</I>&gt;<i> nasty ones.
</I>
As a side note, the setting of PythonAutoReload did not make any difference.

&gt;<i> Second is that your success may be determined by what directives you are
</I>&gt;<i> using related to the Python interpreters. If you are using either of the
</I>&gt;<i> directives PythonInterpPerDirective or PythonInterPerDirectory then you can
</I>&gt;<i> have problems. Some of these are related to bugs in 3.1.4, some of which
</I>&gt;<i> are fixed in 3.2.10.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic problem with interpreters here is that if you are using these
</I>&gt;<i> directives, or even if you are using PythonInterpreter directive
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly, is that the inithandler() could be executed within the context
</I>&gt;<i> of a different interpreter to your handler(). To check, out messages to the
</I>&gt;<i> Apache error log in both which show the value of req.interpreter.
</I>
I'm not using any of those directives, and the req.interpreter stayed the same 
(the name of the virtual host).

&gt;<i> You need to know the correct set of directives to use in order to get the
</I>&gt;<i> authhandler() and authzhandler() to trigger. This includes use of the
</I>&gt;<i> Require directive but possible also AuthType and AuthName. Problem is that
</I>&gt;<i> in 3.1.4 even if you can get it to trigger you still may have problems if
</I>&gt;<i> you have multiple stacked auth[z]?handler() functions as mod_python doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter return status codes properly. This is fixed in 3.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suggest you post to the mailing list what directives you were using to try
</I>&gt;<i> and attempt to trigger the authzhandler().
</I>
I saw a thread about this where you gave some advice, but I couldn't get 
things to work. And I can't remember the set of directives now. Is it Apache 
that needs to be induced into the auth/authz phases, or is it mod_python?

Thanks for the reply Graham!

Cheerio, Gavin.
