</I>
Not that it will matter, but where are you storing the thread local variable?
Is that in a module that can be reloaded automatically by mod_python?

Maybe someone else who has Python with native thread local storage can
try it. I only have 2.3.5 which I believe can't do it.

&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, first off is that there are bugs in mod_python 3.1.4 related
</I>&gt;<i> to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creation of the Python interpreters and thread locking. I am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this would affect use of thread local storage, perhaps not depending
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where the data is held, but would definitely suggest you upgrade to 3.2.10.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are no 3.2 ebuilds in Gentoo yet, so I'll hang on for the moment.
</I>&gt;<i> I 
</I>&gt;<i> could upgrade by hand, but I have to be able to repeat this easily on other
</I>&gt;<i> machines and I'm short on time. Sorry about that. I'll have a look at the
</I>&gt;<i> change log and try not to whine too much about things that are fixed :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This doesn't eliminate all module reloading problems, but gets rid of
</I>&gt;<i> a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nasty ones.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note, the setting of PythonAutoReload did not make any difference.
</I>
Was fixed in 3.2.8.

&gt;<i> &gt; You need to know the correct set of directives to use in order to get
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authhandler() and authzhandler() to trigger. This includes use of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Require directive but possible also AuthType and AuthName. Problem is
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in 3.1.4 even if you can get it to trigger you still may have problems
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you have multiple stacked auth[z]?handler() functions as mod_python doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpreter return status codes properly. This is fixed in 3.3.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suggest you post to the mailing list what directives you were using to
</I>&gt;<i> try
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and attempt to trigger the authzhandler().
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I saw a thread about this where you gave some advice, but I couldn't get
</I>&gt;<i> things to work. And I can't remember the set of directives now. Is it Apache
</I>&gt;<i> that needs to be induced into the auth/authz phases, or is it mod_python?
</I>
It is Apache that has to be prodded into running the auth/authz handler
phases.
