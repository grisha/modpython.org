</I>&gt;<i> What PSP does is that if it sees that the variable &quot;session&quot; is referenced
</I>&gt;<i> from inside of PSP code, then it will do what is necessary to create the
</I>&gt;<i> session, or if the session already exists, it will retrieve it from the
</I>&gt;<i> session database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two problems could be occurring here. The first is that if this is
</I>&gt;<i> occurring on the very first time the session needs to be created, that the
</I>&gt;<i> session database it tries to use is corrupt in some way and therefore
</I>&gt;<i> crashing. The second is that the session already exists in the database,
</I>&gt;<i> but something was stored in the session object that probably shouldn't have
</I>&gt;<i> and when the session object is being restored, it is triggering some code
</I>&gt;<i> (possibly C code) which is then subsequently crashing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First thing you need to do is get out of PSP and write a simple handler
</I>&gt;<i> that creates a session object just to validate that sessions work and that
</I>&gt;<i> the session database is okay. Use a handler such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; from mod_python import Session
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; from mod_python import apache
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; def handler(req):
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; session = Session.Session(req)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; session['data'] = 1
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; session.save()
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; req.content_type = 'text/plain'
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; req.write('hello')
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; return apache .OK
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this dies, then there is possibly a problem with the session
</I>&gt;<i> database, or your Python DBM modules are stuffed somehow. You need to
</I>&gt;<i> work out what type of session database is being used. It will probably
</I>&gt;<i> be DBM database and it will be stored in &quot;/tmp&quot; as &quot;/tmp/mp_sess.dbm&quot;. I
</I>&gt;<i> am guessing you aren't on Win32 as in that case an in memory session
</I>&gt;<i> database is being used and it would be almost impossible to crash. Which
</I>&gt;<i> is might be is dictated by the MPM which Apache was configured with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming it is DBM, check who owns the database in &quot;/tmp&quot;. The owner
</I>&gt;<i> should match the user that Apache runs as. If you have multiple versions
</I>&gt;<i> of Apache running and they run as different users, you could have problems
</I>&gt;<i> because of that. If it is the wrong user and you only have one Apache
</I>&gt;<i> instance, you could try deleting the database and restarting Apache.
</I>&gt;<i> If you have multiple versions of Apache running as different users, you
</I>&gt;<i> may have to use PythonOption to change location where session database
</I>&gt;<i> is stored. See documentation for mod_python.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is all okay, may be what you are storing in the session object.

Hi Graham, thanks for the reply and explanation.
That simple handler does die. The dbm file in /tmp checks out ok, it's the 
correct user and I haven't actually managed to store anything in it yet. This 
is the first use of it; In fact, If I rename it (the dbm file) and restart 
apache it doesn't get recreated so I guess that leaves me with the python DBM 
modules. 
I'll have a dig around and see what I can come up with. 
I do vaguely remember a caffeine fuelled evening running into problems with 
sleepycat which sounds like it might be connected (maybe library versions?). 
Is there any extra debugging info I can turn on to point me in the right 
direction? Otherwise I suppose it's trying to test out the dbm stuff in a 
python shell first and take it from there.

Cheers,
Emlyn.
