Subject: [mod_python] memory consumption increase on httpd reload
Message-ID: <CA+puXg-3H18tGppUSs-e5G17=OWSZLnMXc0S27wCvSCN+B_TpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have observed an issue wherein httpd process memory consumption is
increased when ever the httpd process is "reload". We have boiled the issue
that it is due to only with inclusion of mod_python package.

This is observed on both Centos 5.4 and Centos 6.4 versions. Please provide
the inputs.

regards,
Aman Aggarwal

Aman

It's hard to say what might be the cause of that without more detail on how
mod_python is configured and exactly what you mean by "reload". It also
might be that CentOS 5.4 and 6.4 have an outdated version of mod_python and
this bug may be fixed already.

How much of a memory increase are you observing, and is that really a
problem? Also, are you actually using mod_python, if not, may be the fix is
as simple as to remove it from the configuration?

Regards,

Grisha
