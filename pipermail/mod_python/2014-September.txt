Subject: [mod_python] memory consumption increase on httpd reload
Message-ID: <CA+puXg-3H18tGppUSs-e5G17=OWSZLnMXc0S27wCvSCN+B_TpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

We have observed an issue wherein httpd process memory consumption is
increased when ever the httpd process is "reload". We have boiled the issue
that it is due to only with inclusion of mod_python package.

This is observed on both Centos 5.4 and Centos 6.4 versions. Please provide
the inputs.

regards,
Aman Aggarwal
