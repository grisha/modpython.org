Subject: [mod_python] How stable is current git version?
Message-ID: <CAJ7gMNey8TEySxKAHJrYRDaQ6xrmV2iaZgAjG0Bu2fOX4FaLBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi.

I'm currently considering porting my project to python3. Part of the
application depends on mod_python. How stable is the current master
branch in git? I see that the development has been quite stagnant, is
that, perhapse a sign of stability?

In relation, I built the current git version and the mod_python tool
complains about the StriongIO module. That particular error is easy to
fix, but there are others too.

Thanks.

Stanislav

It should be pretty stable, since (as you've noticed) no new features are
introduced, just small fixes.

Regarding the StringIO error, I'd appreciate it if you created an issue on
github for it.

Regards,

Grisha
