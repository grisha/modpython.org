<PRE>I have written an adapter for mod_wsgi which is code compatible for Mod_python programs.
My mod_python CMS runs now on top of mod_wsgi without any changes to the code.

It is really small and consists of one index.wsgi to created the req object and call the handler and a &quot;fake&quot; python package for the apache.py, Session.Py, Cookie.py etc. (I did need to change some stuff in there)
I did this for my own use since I like the Req object and to pass it around, so my code is very dependent on MP. I have completely turned over Session.Py for my own session management which stores in MySQL and has License stuff etc.

I consider it Beta since I am the only one running it and do not touch all the code.

This code is free to use by anybody (Be aware it should be GPL or so). At the moment there is no CVS or License simply because I do not have the time to set stuff like that up (never did that before). I just started coding Python with Eclipse and Pydev as preparation on starting CVS use.

Drop me an email if u r interested I'll help you out using email/MSN Messenger/Skype etc.

I do not know about cheetah, I think on that part you can use the parts you are already using.


Regards,

Martijn
