Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.05.10111011615360.11470-100000@timeless.exelixis.com>

hello,

first i tried the PythonImport directive to preload modules setting up a
db connection pool.  but the connections were dead when i tried to use
them.

second, i tried modifying the sitecustomize module which gets imported
from the site module at interpreter startup (supposedly).  this gave me
good connections, but it doesn't happen until the first page gets loaded.

i'd like to stuff some pretty time-consuming setup tasks into this phase
of startup... it should already be done when the first page is requested.

any ideas?

You might try forcing everything to run under the main insterpreter by
sticking

PythonInterpreter main_interpreter

somehwere in httpd.conf. This way PythonImport (which only runs under main
insterpreter) and everything else will run in one interpreter and you
should see the connections (may be).

PythonImport is a flaky directive for a couple of reasons. First, there is
the subinterpreter problem. Second, the apache startup is a bit more
complicated than one may think, at the time when PythonImport is executed
(which is at child initialization time), the config has not yet been
parsed (or rather it has, but the child has no access to it yet).

The bottom line is your mileage may vary with PythonImport.

Message-ID: <20011102173647.E20474@vestdata.no>

Hi

How does the current working directory get set when working with
mod_python?

The problem is that my handler (and modules imported by the handler) is
trying to access local files, but it can't find them because the current
directory is not set "properly". 

I tried adding os.chdir() in my handler, but it seems the cwd is still
random for modules imported from my handler.

Maybe someone could shed some light on this?

I think the best thing would be that the directory of the handler would
be the cwd both when importing the handler and other modules, but if I
could only set it manually that would also be ok.

Thanks.

mod_python doesn't change the current directory, so it's whatever apache
happens to have as cwd, probably the dir from which it was started.

really old versions used to behave exactly as you say, but this had to be
removed, because changing cwd is not a thread-safe operation.

my recommendation is to avoid chdir() and use full paths

I implemented a very simple session module which mostly works --- it
worked well enough for the task I had at the time. It generates an
opaque session identifier which corresponds to the name of a file on
disk containing pickled session data.

As I look at it now, it isn't robust in the face of multiple clients
sharing the session id, but as I said it was written in about twenty
minutes for an internal app.

Are there any decent ones? I remember doing a brief search and not
finding anything I immediately liked.

I'd certainly be interested in tossing my code over the fence as the
seed for a more robust session manager.

I wrote a session manager for my project dubbed Python.ASP. (It is an ASP
like but far more powerfull active server page framework using python as the
scripting language.) The session manager uses a hybrid cookie/url mechanism
to pass a session id which is used to store and retrieve the database backed
session data. It also performs robot detection. The project is finished but
I won't have time to document it, write an installation procedure and
release it for some time. The session module is somewhat difficult to lift
out of the ASP framework, but if you want to take a look at the code,
contact me by mail and I'll send it to you.

Subject: [mod_python] Redirect from publisher?
Message-ID: <20011106125013.A687@tyche.svt.tu-harburg.de>

Some of my mod_python.publisher functions want to redirect the client to
another URL under certain conditions (e.g. redirect from a secure server
to an insecure or vice versa).

Do you consider this a bad idea?

My first approach would be to let the publisher function set an
attribute of the request object and return nothing, so that a special
handler (called after the publisher) can do the redirect (as described
in the FAQ). What do you think?

TIA

If there is a way to search the archive for my answer, please
direct me to that.

My question is, what are the security options with mod_python? For
example, running python through CGI scripts allows the system owner to
wrap the script with cgiwrap, sbox, suexec or some other thing that can
make the program run with the permission of the owner, and not with
permission of Apache, so as to prevent users from hurting each other or
the system.

The mod_php partially answers this with "safe mode" and "openbasedir" that
govern what file activities a PHP script is allowed to do like
opening for reading (though everything still runs as apache).

Does mod_python have something similar to or better than "safe mode"? If
you are running mod_python can any user on the system write a python
script that can do anything the webserver has permission to do?

Thanks for any help,

Allen

Message-ID: <B80DFD69.8BE1%steve@ihonk.com>

Hi,

I'm happily playing with mod_python 2.76 on Redhat 7.2. First I'd like to
say thanks for the docs. They're very well written -- I only wish you'd
written a whole book instead. :-) I'm looking forward to writing a customer
application in it.

I'm using mod_python.publisher to allow URL-level access to functions inside
a module, and I want to test protection of a function by prefixing its name
with an underscore. So first I set up httpd.conf with these lines:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

Then I entered this into the module, myscript.py:

from mod_python import apache

def _blah(req):

    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("Uh oh, you shouldn't be seeing this...")

    return apache

So when I go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1/myscript.py/blah", I get varying
results each time I reload the page. Sometimes I just get the "Uh oh" line
of text, other times I get the line of text plus Apache's version & modules
info, plus an Apache internal error message. If I remove the underscore, it
behaves as it should, just giving me the line of text.

Did I misunderstand this whole underscore thing?

Also, I may have a correction for the docs. In section 3.4, in the feedback
form HTML, in order to get the demo to work I had to change the action
element to read:

<form action="form.py/email" method="POST">

Was this just a doc mistake, or does it indicate that something is different
about my setup?

Finally, RH comes with threaded Python. What are the potential problems
stemming from this?

Thanks for your help!

Yes, pretty much.

I'm not familiar with what PHP does, though at first glance this looks
like semi-security - if the process still runs as the httpd user, there's
probably still a great risk of someone finding a way around the barriers
PHP imposes... But then again I don't know first thing about it.

Apache 2.0 should have a native solution to this problem
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/perchild.html), so there is probably
no point in trying to engineer something through mod_python, especially
considering I have no control over the actual Python interpreter code
itself (unlike the PHP people).

In this case the cwd is different every time - seems to change with the
last object accessed by that particular child.

I don't understand this, because AFAIK there are no threads involved!

full paths is not an option, because the same source-code is checked out
of CVS into multiple directories.

I suppose I can use __file__ to generate the full path, but it seems
hackish.

Not sure I understand why you need a special handler for it, something
like this should work with the publisher:

     req.headers_out['location'] = 'http://www.modpython.org/'
     req.status = apache.HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY
     return "You are being redirected to http://www.modpython.org/"

On Win32 Apache 1.3 is multithreaded.

Message-ID: <003401c1677b$d4c9ae30$fd01a8c0@mixio7jpsmlatx>

Hi all,

This mail is basically intended for developpers of  NT or W2K -based 
web applications who are willing to test win+Python as a web platform
or have difficulties in running their mod_python apps under windows.

Just wanted to post a few words to say how great mod_python is and
share a bit of code...

As far we are concerned, this works great and fast.  
Our current development combination is:
- WIN2K server,
- apache 1.3
- mod_python,
- python
- mxodbc for db connectivity.

This combo works great for database-app applications requiring a lot of buffered 
databased-informations intensive sql querying.

It took us less than 2 months to do switch a whole demanding app from 
ms-tool based development on winK2 to apache+mod_python on winK2  .... 
including learning python, a short and enjoyable experience :)

The result is great and fast as all demanding queries are buffered in
global dictionnaries. The only problems we have encoutered are :
- threading,
- threading,
- threading.

Python is threaded, apache-win is threaded .. Be aware that
your mod_python code should also be. 

It took us A COUPLE OF WEEKS to grasp pbs that occured in 
demanding race-conditions and then solve them. 

This is the reason for this mail. Intended for those with limited
skills with thread. Programming data-intensive python+mod_python apps 
on win32 is an easy game including for programmers with limited IT background. 

BUT it is imperative to code threadsafe when coding wK2+apache+mod_python.

For those with no experience with building threadsafe code
applications (possibly the case if you work with interpreted languages),
a few recommendations for mod_python:
1) use as few globals as possible,
pass over your "state-variables" as local python objects and keep
shared variables to the absolute mimimum.

2) make sure to avoid race-conditions on those globals

if you need global (you will if you want high perfs - to store buffered database output), 
make sure those global variables are updated in a tight block of code with a lock
to prevent concurrent threads to access "shared info" whilst this
information is beeing updated

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe mod_python code:

##################################
# in mod_python init code
global_data_lock = threading.RLock()

##################################
# in your mod_python code
# run when needed
global global_data_lock 
global_data_lock.acquire()
try:
   # load or update your shared data .. dictionnaries and al
   load_shared_data()
finally:
   global_data_lock.release()

 
3 ) odbc connectivy (thru mxodbc) may or not be threadsafe

Encapsulate your odbc connections in a "pool" of connections
with round-robin access to them through a shared queue
(a "webwarish" bit of code, my thanks to webware, 
a great tool we'd like to investigate soon)

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe odbc python :

#################################
# in mod_python init code
# build a series of sleeping odbc connections
NB_CONNECTIONS = 20
connection_queue = Queue()
for each_value in range(NB_CONNECTIONS):
  database_handle = ODBC.Windows.Connect('my_dsn','my_user','my_password',0)
  connection_queue.put(database_handle) 

##################################
# in your database code
# use them in round-robin
# every time
global connection_queue
database_handle = connection_queue.get()
cursor_handle = database_handle.cursor()
cursor_handle.execute("SELECT * FROM DUMMY")
connection_queue.put(database_handle)

mod_python on win32 rocks!

Thanks for your answer. It's what I needed to know.

I looked at the MPM stuff in Apache 2.0 and it looks like you need to
specify "AssignUserId" in a <VirtualHost> container of the httpd.conf
file. That sort of defeats the purpose of mod_vhost_alias which let you
make a directory and be on your way with a new virtual host.

Since Apache 2.0 will be capable of changing the UID of the child
process anyway, it would have been great if they could just make the
child process the same UID as the file that was about to be served.

That would fix mod_php and mod_python so that user's scripts can only do
what that user can do. No need to change httpd.conf and restart apache
every time you get a new user.

	Is there a way to store data, like sessions, persistantly accross all 
backends? In other words, if I set a variable it will remain persistant for 
the one apache backend (right?), but will it remain visible to other backends?

	Also, if anyone has any experience with other session modules, I would 
appreciate input. I would prefer that it be stable, and somewhat scalable 
(for concurrent access). I know a few exist, but the "Vaults of Parnassus" 
don't seem to contain many such modules.

A sneak preview of Python.ASP can be found at:
http://www.boskant.nl/geert/python.asp-PREVIEW.tar.gz

I noticed I wrote a document on session management! It is in the archive
too.

DISCLAIMER: There is no documenatation yet, and neither an install
procedure. You need mysql to run it. You also need the latest mod_python 2.X
CVS to run it. (or search the mod_python archives for my patch). And there
is a performance drain I didn't find yet. Oh well... have fun! ;)

Hi,

I'm happily playing with mod_python 2.76 on Redhat 7.2. First I'd like to
say thanks for the docs. They're very well written -- I only wish you'd
written a whole book instead. :-) I'm looking forward to writing a customer
application in it.

I'm using mod_python.publisher to allow URL-level access to functions inside
a module, and I want to test protection of a function by prefixing its name
with an underscore. So first I set up httpd.conf with these lines:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

Then I entered this into the module, myscript.py:

from mod_python import apache

def _blah(req):

    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("Uh oh, you shouldn't be seeing this...")

    return apache

So when I go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1/myscript.py/blah", I get varying
results each time I reload the page. Sometimes I just get the "Uh oh" line
of text, other times I get the line of text plus Apache's version & modules
info, plus an Apache internal error message. If I remove the underscore, it
behaves as it should, just giving me the line of text.

Did I misunderstand this whole underscore thing?

Also, I may have a correction for the docs. In section 3.4, in the feedback
form HTML, in order to get the demo to work I had to change the action
element to read:

<form action="form.py/email" method="POST">

Was this just a doc mistake, or does it indicate that something is different
about my setup?

Finally, RH comes with threaded Python. What are the potential problems
stemming from this?

Thanks for your help!

Though I'm kind of surprised you were getting anything at all, you were
supposed to get "not found" or "forbidden". Make sure your config says

PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

You can try defining -DEAPI by editing src/Makefile, then doing make
clean; make. But I doubt that this is the problem.

I'd try running mod_python without some of the other modules running, to
see if there a complict of some sort.

Hello,

I have just compiled ModPython-2.7.6 for Apache-1.3.22 on Debian Linux
(version 2.2 enhanced with a lot of packages -- including Apache -- picked
from the upcoming 3.0 distribution). On loading ModPython DSO, the Apache
server warns about a possible crash if it was compiled without the -DEAPI
option. Passing this option to gcc in src/Makefile apparently solves the
issue. (It is actually used inside apxs, but apxs is used for linking of
the final DSO only, not for compiling the C sources). Should we install
this modification to src/Makefile? (This option would probably do no harm
in case of older Apache servers which do not support EAPI)?

Sincerely,

As fas as I understand, if Apache didn't crash immediately after or even
before issuing the EAPI warning, then you're using one of those C
compliers (gcc probably) that fill missing parts of strucures with NULLs
and you're safe.

But if the warning bothers you, you can add OPTS=-DEAPI in src Makefile.
Other than suppressing the warning, it will have no effect whatsover.

The issue is not that parts are missing, but that the structure changed
size.

You got lucky.  It might be you got lucky all the time, it might be you
got lucky each time the program started.

It's like this.  Create a file foo.c:
	char buf[4] = { 'h', 'i', 't', 't' };
	int x = 1234;
Create a file bar.c
	#include <stdio.h>
	extern char buf[8];
	int main(int ac, char **av) {
		printf("%s\n", buf);
		return 0;
	}
Compile and run
	cc foo.c bar.c ; ./a.out

It all depends on how your compiler and linker and operating system lay
out the data.

The ONLY safe thing to do is compile ALL your modules with -DEAPI

Hi. If I end up having to use mod_python with an installation of Python
which has been compiled with threads, what are the drawbacks and risks?

Thanks,

It does say that, so I guess it's behaving wrongly. Anything I can do to
troubleshoot?

I don't know a heck of a lot about windows... but you might try looking at 
httpd.conf (or whatever the main apache configuration file is called). You 
need to somewhere load the python module (using the LoadModule command) in 
order for apaceh to recognize that command. That assumes that you built 
mod_python as a dynamic shared object.

Please send along a little more info about your problem:
1) how did you build mod_python (is it a shared object or built into apache)?
2) show the pieces of httpd.conf that are supposed to initialize the python 
module (i.e. point to the library you built).
3) what troubleshooting have you already tried (I don't know "everything in 
this list")?

I'm a refugee from PHP4 and would really like to
use something the equivalent of PHP4s sessions ?

I've spent hours going thru the mail archives and
there seems to be some reluctance (?) to accumulate
mod_python examples, or something... they're really
hard to find and essential when trying to learn python
itself, and how it fits in with mod_python, and keeping
the peace between 1.5, 2.0, 2.1 and... 

Surely there is a site out there that specializes in
mod_python scripts ? I assumed modpython.org would
have heaps of examples, but nada except the handlers
included in the package itself. Strange.

Maybe there is a lack of interest because mod_python is thought to be on a
lower level than PHP. I see mod_python as apache/python integration
software, not as a e-content system. There are no templates, no sessions,
there is no standard library. These of course can all be built on top of
mod_python, but there is (not yet) a standard content system that is
regarded as _the_ content system for mod_python. [yes, I know the publisher,
but I don't consider that to be a full blown e-content system]

Sessions, for example, would require a database to back the session data,
something that is out of scope for mod_python. Also templates would be
handy.

AFAIK there is some software (webware, cheetah, ...) out there that builds
on mod_python but I didn't like it. That's why I wrote my own e-content
system. If you seach the archives you'll find a link to a preview version of
it.

I agree with you that this distinction should be made more clear. IMHO
mod_python is _not_ an e-content system. It is not a PHP.

Sessions require much more than just a few lines of code.

I don't expect it to be either and I'm not really after
someone elses idea of what a CMS should be, but various
low(ish) level components like a generic sessions system
written by people far more experienced in python than me
would give me more confidence that something so close to
authentication is done right.

I'm after a PHP4 sessions clone, persistant store in /tmp
and fallback to transparent URL if cookies are not available.

Anyone out there know of any such beast ?

This seems like a rather simple and generic requirement to me.
Obviously if I was more competent in python I would be able
to knock something together, and also put it somewhere public
to save other PHP4 refugees from extra overload and confusion
when/if they start to consider python.

"search the archives"... hmm, wish I knew how to do that ?
Am I supposed to just keep looking thru all these messages
until I find the right one ?

Maybe you have not actually used PHP(4) but it is
certainly not a CMS either. It takes a lot of PHP code
to make a decent content management system... and to
be clear, my use of the meaning "PHP-like" simply means
not being an oh-so dumb and slow CGI. I am not looking
for a CMS (tho a "good" one would be nice) but some sane
python system that are not CGIs (that's going backwards
from using PHP, not forward).

mod_python + publisher is the closest I've been able to
find to PHP, so far, and looks potentially more powerful,
just missing a few of key components.

I don't know of any, but I didn't really look for it either. Using
transparent URL cookies would imply filtering the handler output though. I
don't think there are hooks for doing this in mod_python. This is must
easier done from the handler of a CMS.

I'm sorry, I was under the impression that a search option was available.

Is there an xmlrpc-handler for mod_python? Or would using
the SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler of the 2.2 SimpleXMLRPCServer
module be a natural thing to do? It just seems that Apache/mod_python
would be a more stable server solution than using SimpleXMLRPCServer
itself...

I think this is the same as:

     Alias /cgi-bin/ "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin/"

     <Directory "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin">
	 SetHandler cgi-script
         AddHandler python-program .py
         PythonHandler mptest
         PythonAuthenHandler mptest
         PythonDebug on
         AllowOverride None
         Options None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>

Off the top of my head I don't know whether AddHandler will override
SetHandler OR whichever module is envoked first (mod_python or
mod_cgi) will handler the request. You might want to try moving around
LoadModule directives in your config to see what happens.

In any event it should either work fine or not at all - why do you say
"sort of"?

Judging by your sig I take it this is on Linux?

I haven't tested any of it on Linux. I'm doing most of mp 3.0 development
on Solaris because it's got the best thread support of all os's I have
access to.

Anyhow, this message would mean that something went wrong during
compile/link - stat is a standard C library function, it shouldn't be
missing...

Sorry, this isn't being too helpful, but then this _is_ alpha code ;-)

I don't know of such a thing offhand.  Probably the best thing to do
would be to start with the SimpleXMLRPCServer code and port the
request handler to mod_python.  It probably wouldn't be that hard to
do, but it won't be a simple plug-n-play solution, either.  It's
probably only _worth_ doing if you're going to handle some serious
load.

If you can use SOAP instead of XML RPC, you can use ZSI -- it's pretty
trivial to integrate into mod_python.  On purpose.  zsi is at
pywebsvcs.sf.net

Message-ID: <200111181438.fAIEcWS12385@eden.ispol.com>

I'm sure this worked for me a few days ago (maybe
I was imaginging it and some rotuine nearby happened
to be working);

 if req._req.subprocess_env.has_key("REMOTE_ADDR"):
   rn = req._req.subprocess_env["REMOTE_ADDR"]

but now the above test is failing and when I try to
see where REMOTE_ADDR has gone I get these results...

 for k in req._req.subprocess_env.keys():
   e.write(k+"\n")

UNIQUE_ID
WE_HAVE_REWRITE
UNIQUE_ID
WE_HAVE_REWRITE
GATEWAY_INTERFACE
SERVER_PROTOCOL
REQUEST_METHOD
QUERY_STRING
REQUEST_URI
SCRIPT_NAME
PATH_INFO
PATH_TRANSLATED

Is it possible that REMOTE_ADDR has been somehow
over written by the duplication of UNIQUE_ID and
WE_HAVE_REWRITE ?

I'm a python and mod_python novice so maybe my
question should be simply "how do I find REMOTE_ADDR
under mod_python" ?

Subject: [mod_python] multi-line headers in multipart/form-data
Message-ID: <59228917536.20011119221740@Vex.Net>

I found that some http clients (Opera on windows, specifically in my
tests) use multi-line headers in some mime-parts... the same way email
clients do (with whitespace leading the continued lines). mod_python's
util.py appears to not support this.

Here's my quick patch to hack around the problem for me, if anyone
else is using multipart/form-data forms.

Or maybe someone has a better hack...

Have anyone tried doing a HTTP POST from a form to a script running under
mod_python.cgihandler ?

I keep getting this error
python_handler: Dispatch() returned nothing.

If I disable mod_python and run this script under the CGI environment, it
works fine.

Btw, the script works if I do a HTTP GET instead of a HTTP POST.

It would be hard to identify the problem without the seeing the script.
POST should work fine.

I have managed to solve the problem putting
LoadModule modules/mod_python.so 
as the last line of all the LoadModule commands and
AddModule mod_python.c
as the last line of all the AddModule commands.
This helps to kill the problem which I had previously.

Anyway, my test CGI script is very simple.

-- Start of script --
import cgi, os, sys

print 'Content-type: text/plain'
print
print os.environ()
print cgi.FieldStorage()

-- End of script --

You shouldn't need to use --with-python for this, your libpython will know
to look in /usr/local (if that's the prefix you compiled Python with,
which, BTW, is the default I think anyway)

I think your message means Apache process doesn't have persmissions to the
Python library directories.

Horray! I got the Hello World script to work.  I had to recompile python into /usr since my apache user didn't have /usr/local in the path and I wanted it in /usr anyway.  I recompiled mod_python as well and put the -DEAPI flag in the Makefile since apache kept complaining about the API config and to use this flag.  Anyway, I got it to work and I get a beautiful "hello world"

Now, what the hell do I do?  If I put another sample script (not called mptest.py but another name) in the directory where mptest.py resides, I just keep getting Hello World.  Do I have to push everything through mptest.py or what?  I am a bit confused as to how to actually do something with this mod_python.  Anyone?

Thanks for some of your suggestions. I checked security but system has full
control at modules and the specific .dll.

This is the file that is giving me headeaches:

 <<httpd.conf>> 

As in the manual I included both parts (LoadModule & <Directory>)

But when restarting Apache http server I stiil get:

"Invalid command PythonHandler, ...mispelled or module not in server
config.".

Thanks very much for any ideas (must be a simple and/or stupid mistake I
guess :)).

I had a look at your config and there is no sign of
loading up the mod_python module into apache, which
would explain the error you are seeing...

On Linux I use this in my httpd.conf...

 LoadModule python_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_python.so

If that is missing then it will definately help :)

Dear Mark,

There IS actaully in this file a line (I just copied it from it...):

LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.dll

should it be in some other place or contain an absolute path (which is not
in the manual)
or should it be:

LoadModule python_module modules\mod_python.dll (backslash)

Hi Mark,

thats right, I tried all slashes: no success

I tried all configurations here (within quotes otherwise you get other
errors like this command is taking only 2 arguments which is ok). I tried
absolute path with slashes and backslashes: no success.

I put it in the right version (checked 3 times) in the standards "modules"
directory with the right permissions within the Apache folder which is
itself also in the standard place.

As you can see above I tried all perbutations I think :)

The error log stays clean.
The access log says clean.

Restart gives exactly same result as "Test Configuration functionality.

thanks, very kind

anyway, your effort is very much appreciated, Michel

the only thing I can think of is that I have to go back to an earlier
version of Apache (1.3.20 iso 1.3.22). I am going to try that first....

In the meantime, python/win expert ideas are still welcome.....

Thanks Michel

Dear All (esp. Mark, Dan and Grisha),

I swapped Apache 1.3.22 for 1.3.20 and my problem was solved. So advice:
stick with Apache 1.3.20 on windows if you want to have an integrated Python
!

Thanks for all your help, Michel

Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python 2.7.6 + Python 2.1.1 + Windows XP professonal
works fine for me, so I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong
with Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python.

FYI
I have compiled Apache 1.3.22 and mod_python with the
current Cygwin tools

This requires changing the mod_python / src / Makefile
to link with libpython2.1.dll.a instead of libpython2.1.a

Cheers

Ahhh, things getting clearer now (I though the numbers shpould
correspond....)

so I will also now try to mix 2.7.4 & 2.7.6 ... (where probabl. 2.7.5
alaready solved the problem I experienced)

You also need "AddModule mod_python.c" somewhere after ClearModuleList.

Just not to confuse people any further, your problem was with your config
file. Whenever you use ClearModuleList, you have to AddModule afterwards.

This, BTW, has nothing to do with mod_python, and is all well documented
in Apache docs.

Dear Grisha,

1
It was not my intention to confuse people any further; I was just stuck and
asked for help.

2
On your second remark on the actual problem I disagree:

2.1
"Whenever you use ClearModuleList..."

I have never explicitly used it ! Ok it can be default in some config but
you suggested I added something..

2.2
"You have to AddModule".
Please show me in the manual appendix A (win install) where this is; its
just not there.

2.3
Looking at the doc it seems that AddModule is only relevant for static
links. But of course this might be me....

my reasoning: I downloaded a binary .dll so how can I reference a source
file in the httpd.conf.

2.4
I think above is true since everything seems to work fine now after the mail
I got from Ray Drew (actually combining .ddl with higher version mod_python;
thanks Ray !)

Again, sorry if I caused any incomvenience to anybody. I just come from the
structured world of Gates and now try from a more or less end-user oriented
perspective to integrate a SW infrastructure combining Apache, xalan,
xerces, cocoon, python, and some more and then our own stuff on top. I just
want to find out which problems real end-user will face when we tell them
please do this yourself....

Greetings, Michel Bohms

Dear Grischa,

I have been using mod_python for over a year now, and before that NSAPY. Many times I have developed code for mod_python that would have to be able to run as a CGI or as a script. So I wrote a bridge to handle these situations. Also I parameterized the Publisher handler and gave it transparent session handling. By breaking up this code  I acheived better control over and made the Handler easier to custimize.  Should I contribute this work to mod_python.org. If so, how?  I will galdly tidy it up and document it. Also my version of the Publisher has most of your code just lifted in, then slightly re-worked. I will be happy to have your recomendations regarding the wording of the copyright etc.

Thank you very much. You can simply e-mail it to me - we will then review
it and if all is well, add it to the future releases of mod_python.

hello,

first i tried the PythonImport directive to preload modules setting up a
db connection pool.  but the connections were dead when i tried to use
them.

second, i tried modifying the sitecustomize module which gets imported
from the site module at interpreter startup (supposedly).  this gave me
good connections, but it doesn't happen until the first page gets loaded.

i'd like to stuff some pretty time-consuming setup tasks into this phase
of startup... it should already be done when the first page is requested.

any ideas?

You might try forcing everything to run under the main insterpreter by
sticking

PythonInterpreter main_interpreter

somehwere in httpd.conf. This way PythonImport (which only runs under main
insterpreter) and everything else will run in one interpreter and you
should see the connections (may be).

PythonImport is a flaky directive for a couple of reasons. First, there is
the subinterpreter problem. Second, the apache startup is a bit more
complicated than one may think, at the time when PythonImport is executed
(which is at child initialization time), the config has not yet been
parsed (or rather it has, but the child has no access to it yet).

The bottom line is your mileage may vary with PythonImport.

Subject: [mod_python] Current working directory
Message-ID: <20011102173647.E20474@vestdata.no>

Hi

How does the current working directory get set when working with
mod_python?

The problem is that my handler (and modules imported by the handler) is
trying to access local files, but it can't find them because the current
directory is not set "properly". 

I tried adding os.chdir() in my handler, but it seems the cwd is still
random for modules imported from my handler.

Maybe someone could shed some light on this?

I think the best thing would be that the directory of the handler would
be the cwd both when importing the handler and other modules, but if I
could only set it manually that would also be ok.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <200111022358.PAA05451@smtp.ucsd.edu>

	I wanted to somehow inplement sessions in mod_python and I know it can 
retain data between requests. My question is: does it still have access to

mod_python doesn't change the current directory, so it's whatever apache
happens to have as cwd, probably the dir from which it was started.

really old versions used to behave exactly as you say, but this had to be
removed, because changing cwd is not a thread-safe operation.

my recommendation is to avoid chdir() and use full paths

I implemented a very simple session module which mostly works --- it
worked well enough for the task I had at the time. It generates an
opaque session identifier which corresponds to the name of a file on
disk containing pickled session data.

As I look at it now, it isn't robust in the face of multiple clients
sharing the session id, but as I said it was written in about twenty
minutes for an internal app.

Are there any decent ones? I remember doing a brief search and not
finding anything I immediately liked.

I'd certainly be interested in tossing my code over the fence as the
seed for a more robust session manager.

I wrote a session manager for my project dubbed Python.ASP. (It is an ASP
like but far more powerfull active server page framework using python as the
scripting language.) The session manager uses a hybrid cookie/url mechanism
to pass a session id which is used to store and retrieve the database backed
session data. It also performs robot detection. The project is finished but
I won't have time to document it, write an installation procedure and
release it for some time. The session module is somewhat difficult to lift
out of the ASP framework, but if you want to take a look at the code,
contact me by mail and I'll send it to you.

Subject: [mod_python] Redirect from publisher?
Message-ID: <20011106125013.A687@tyche.svt.tu-harburg.de>

Some of my mod_python.publisher functions want to redirect the client to
another URL under certain conditions (e.g. redirect from a secure server
to an insecure or vice versa).

Do you consider this a bad idea?

My first approach would be to let the publisher function set an
attribute of the request object and return nothing, so that a special
handler (called after the publisher) can do the redirect (as described
in the FAQ). What do you think?

TIA

If there is a way to search the archive for my answer, please
direct me to that.

My question is, what are the security options with mod_python? For
example, running python through CGI scripts allows the system owner to
wrap the script with cgiwrap, sbox, suexec or some other thing that can
make the program run with the permission of the owner, and not with
permission of Apache, so as to prevent users from hurting each other or
the system.

The mod_php partially answers this with "safe mode" and "openbasedir" that
govern what file activities a PHP script is allowed to do like
opening for reading (though everything still runs as apache).

Does mod_python have something similar to or better than "safe mode"? If
you are running mod_python can any user on the system write a python
script that can do anything the webserver has permission to do?

Thanks for any help,

Allen

Message-ID: <B80DFD69.8BE1%steve@ihonk.com>

Hi,

I'm happily playing with mod_python 2.76 on Redhat 7.2. First I'd like to
say thanks for the docs. They're very well written -- I only wish you'd
written a whole book instead. :-) I'm looking forward to writing a customer
application in it.

I'm using mod_python.publisher to allow URL-level access to functions inside
a module, and I want to test protection of a function by prefixing its name
with an underscore. So first I set up httpd.conf with these lines:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

Then I entered this into the module, myscript.py:

from mod_python import apache

def _blah(req):

    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("Uh oh, you shouldn't be seeing this...")

    return apache

So when I go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1/myscript.py/blah", I get varying
results each time I reload the page. Sometimes I just get the "Uh oh" line
of text, other times I get the line of text plus Apache's version & modules
info, plus an Apache internal error message. If I remove the underscore, it
behaves as it should, just giving me the line of text.

Did I misunderstand this whole underscore thing?

Also, I may have a correction for the docs. In section 3.4, in the feedback
form HTML, in order to get the demo to work I had to change the action
element to read:

<form action="form.py/email" method="POST">

Was this just a doc mistake, or does it indicate that something is different
about my setup?

Finally, RH comes with threaded Python. What are the potential problems
stemming from this?

Thanks for your help!

Yes, pretty much.

I'm not familiar with what PHP does, though at first glance this looks
like semi-security - if the process still runs as the httpd user, there's
probably still a great risk of someone finding a way around the barriers
PHP imposes... But then again I don't know first thing about it.

Apache 2.0 should have a native solution to this problem
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/perchild.html), so there is probably
no point in trying to engineer something through mod_python, especially
considering I have no control over the actual Python interpreter code
itself (unlike the PHP people).

In this case the cwd is different every time - seems to change with the
last object accessed by that particular child.

I don't understand this, because AFAIK there are no threads involved!

full paths is not an option, because the same source-code is checked out
of CVS into multiple directories.

I suppose I can use __file__ to generate the full path, but it seems
hackish.

Not sure I understand why you need a special handler for it, something
like this should work with the publisher:

     req.headers_out['location'] = 'http://www.modpython.org/'
     req.status = apache.HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY
     return "You are being redirected to http://www.modpython.org/"

Message-ID: <003401c1677b$d4c9ae30$fd01a8c0@mixio7jpsmlatx>

Hi all,

This mail is basically intended for developpers of  NT or W2K -based 
web applications who are willing to test win+Python as a web platform
or have difficulties in running their mod_python apps under windows.

Just wanted to post a few words to say how great mod_python is and
share a bit of code...

As far we are concerned, this works great and fast.  
Our current development combination is:
- WIN2K server,
- apache 1.3
- mod_python,
- python
- mxodbc for db connectivity.

This combo works great for database-app applications requiring a lot of buffered 
databased-informations intensive sql querying.

It took us less than 2 months to do switch a whole demanding app from 
ms-tool based development on winK2 to apache+mod_python on winK2  .... 
including learning python, a short and enjoyable experience :)

The result is great and fast as all demanding queries are buffered in
global dictionnaries. The only problems we have encoutered are :
- threading,
- threading,
- threading.

Python is threaded, apache-win is threaded .. Be aware that
your mod_python code should also be. 

It took us A COUPLE OF WEEKS to grasp pbs that occured in 
demanding race-conditions and then solve them. 

This is the reason for this mail. Intended for those with limited
skills with thread. Programming data-intensive python+mod_python apps 
on win32 is an easy game including for programmers with limited IT background. 

BUT it is imperative to code threadsafe when coding wK2+apache+mod_python.

For those with no experience with building threadsafe code
applications (possibly the case if you work with interpreted languages),
a few recommendations for mod_python:
1) use as few globals as possible,
pass over your "state-variables" as local python objects and keep
shared variables to the absolute mimimum.

2) make sure to avoid race-conditions on those globals

if you need global (you will if you want high perfs - to store buffered database output), 
make sure those global variables are updated in a tight block of code with a lock
to prevent concurrent threads to access "shared info" whilst this
information is beeing updated

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe mod_python code:

##################################
# in mod_python init code
global_data_lock = threading.RLock()

##################################
# in your mod_python code
# run when needed
global global_data_lock 
global_data_lock.acquire()
try:
   # load or update your shared data .. dictionnaries and al
   load_shared_data()
finally:
   global_data_lock.release()

 
3 ) odbc connectivy (thru mxodbc) may or not be threadsafe

Encapsulate your odbc connections in a "pool" of connections
with round-robin access to them through a shared queue
(a "webwarish" bit of code, my thanks to webware, 
a great tool we'd like to investigate soon)

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe odbc python :

#################################
# in mod_python init code
# build a series of sleeping odbc connections
NB_CONNECTIONS = 20
connection_queue = Queue()

Thanks for your answer. It's what I needed to know.

I looked at the MPM stuff in Apache 2.0 and it looks like you need to
specify "AssignUserId" in a <VirtualHost> container of the httpd.conf
file. That sort of defeats the purpose of mod_vhost_alias which let you
make a directory and be on your way with a new virtual host.

Since Apache 2.0 will be capable of changing the UID of the child
process anyway, it would have been great if they could just make the
child process the same UID as the file that was about to be served.

That would fix mod_php and mod_python so that user's scripts can only do
what that user can do. No need to change httpd.conf and restart apache
every time you get a new user.

	Is there a way to store data, like sessions, persistantly accross all 
backends? In other words, if I set a variable it will remain persistant for 
the one apache backend (right?), but will it remain visible to other backends?

	Also, if anyone has any experience with other session modules, I would 
appreciate input. I would prefer that it be stable, and somewhat scalable 
(for concurrent access). I know a few exist, but the "Vaults of Parnassus" 
don't seem to contain many such modules.

A sneak preview of Python.ASP can be found at:
http://www.boskant.nl/geert/python.asp-PREVIEW.tar.gz

I noticed I wrote a document on session management! It is in the archive
too.

DISCLAIMER: There is no documenatation yet, and neither an install
procedure. You need mysql to run it. You also need the latest mod_python 2.X
CVS to run it. (or search the mod_python archives for my patch). And there
is a performance drain I didn't find yet. Oh well... have fun! ;)

Hi,

I'm happily playing with mod_python 2.76 on Redhat 7.2. First I'd like to
say thanks for the docs. They're very well written -- I only wish you'd
written a whole book instead. :-) I'm looking forward to writing a customer
application in it.

I'm using mod_python.publisher to allow URL-level access to functions inside
a module, and I want to test protection of a function by prefixing its name
with an underscore. So first I set up httpd.conf with these lines:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

Then I entered this into the module, myscript.py:

from mod_python import apache

def _blah(req):

    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("Uh oh, you shouldn't be seeing this...")

    return apache

So when I go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1/myscript.py/blah", I get varying
results each time I reload the page. Sometimes I just get the "Uh oh" line
of text, other times I get the line of text plus Apache's version & modules
info, plus an Apache internal error message. If I remove the underscore, it
behaves as it should, just giving me the line of text.

Did I misunderstand this whole underscore thing?

Also, I may have a correction for the docs. In section 3.4, in the feedback
form HTML, in order to get the demo to work I had to change the action
element to read:

<form action="form.py/email" method="POST">

Was this just a doc mistake, or does it indicate that something is different
about my setup?

Finally, RH comes with threaded Python. What are the potential problems
stemming from this?

Thanks for your help!

Though I'm kind of surprised you were getting anything at all, you were
supposed to get "not found" or "forbidden". Make sure your config says

PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

You can try defining -DEAPI by editing src/Makefile, then doing make
clean; make. But I doubt that this is the problem.

I'd try running mod_python without some of the other modules running, to
see if there a complict of some sort.

Hello,

I have just compiled ModPython-2.7.6 for Apache-1.3.22 on Debian Linux
(version 2.2 enhanced with a lot of packages -- including Apache -- picked
from the upcoming 3.0 distribution). On loading ModPython DSO, the Apache
server warns about a possible crash if it was compiled without the -DEAPI
option. Passing this option to gcc in src/Makefile apparently solves the
issue. (It is actually used inside apxs, but apxs is used for linking of
the final DSO only, not for compiling the C sources). Should we install
this modification to src/Makefile? (This option would probably do no harm
in case of older Apache servers which do not support EAPI)?

As fas as I understand, if Apache didn't crash immediately after or even
before issuing the EAPI warning, then you're using one of those C
compliers (gcc probably) that fill missing parts of strucures with NULLs
and you're safe.

But if the warning bothers you, you can add OPTS=-DEAPI in src Makefile.
Other than suppressing the warning, it will have no effect whatsover.

The issue is not that parts are missing, but that the structure changed
size.

You got lucky.  It might be you got lucky all the time, it might be you
got lucky each time the program started.

It's like this.  Create a file foo.c:
	char buf[4] = { 'h', 'i', 't', 't' };
	int x = 1234;
Create a file bar.c
	#include <stdio.h>
	extern char buf[8];
	int main(int ac, char **av) {
		printf("%s\n", buf);
		return 0;
	}
Compile and run
	cc foo.c bar.c ; ./a.out

It all depends on how your compiler and linker and operating system lay
out the data.

The ONLY safe thing to do is compile ALL your modules with -DEAPI

It does say that, so I guess it's behaving wrongly. Anything I can do to

I don't know a heck of a lot about windows... but you might try looking at 
httpd.conf (or whatever the main apache configuration file is called). You 
need to somewhere load the python module (using the LoadModule command) in 
order for apaceh to recognize that command. That assumes that you built 
mod_python as a dynamic shared object.

Please send along a little more info about your problem:
1) how did you build mod_python (is it a shared object or built into apache)?
2) show the pieces of httpd.conf that are supposed to initialize the python 
module (i.e. point to the library you built).
3) what troubleshooting have you already tried (I don't know "everything in 
this list")?

Hi,

my apache version is httpd-2_0_16-beta This is the error I get:

Cannot load /opt/apache2/modules/mod_python.so into server: /opt/apache2/modules/mod_python.so: undefined symbol: stat

        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

and placed the mptest.py inside cgi-bin folder... it (sort of) works fine...

is there something wrong with this?????

I'm a refugee from PHP4 and would really like to

I've spent hours going thru the mail archives and
there seems to be some reluctance (?) to accumulate
mod_python examples, or something... they're really
hard to find and essential when trying to learn python
itself, and how it fits in with mod_python, and keeping
the peace between 1.5, 2.0, 2.1 and... 

Surely there is a site out there that specializes in
mod_python scripts ? I assumed modpython.org would
have heaps of examples, but nada except the handlers
included in the package itself. Strange.

Maybe there is a lack of interest because mod_python is thought to be on a
lower level than PHP. I see mod_python as apache/python integration
software, not as a e-content system. There are no templates, no sessions,
there is no standard library. These of course can all be built on top of
mod_python, but there is (not yet) a standard content system that is
regarded as _the_ content system for mod_python. [yes, I know the publisher,
but I don't consider that to be a full blown e-content system]

Sessions, for example, would require a database to back the session data,
something that is out of scope for mod_python. Also templates would be
handy.

AFAIK there is some software (webware, cheetah, ...) out there that builds
on mod_python but I didn't like it. That's why I wrote my own e-content
system. If you seach the archives you'll find a link to a preview version of
it.

I agree with you that this distinction should be made more clear. IMHO
mod_python is _not_ an e-content system. It is not a PHP.

Sessions require much more than just a few lines of code.

I don't expect it to be either and I'm not really after
someone elses idea of what a CMS should be, but various
low(ish) level components like a generic sessions system
written by people far more experienced in python than me
would give me more confidence that something so close to
authentication is done right.

I'm after a PHP4 sessions clone, persistant store in /tmp
and fallback to transparent URL if cookies are not available.

Anyone out there know of any such beast ?

This seems like a rather simple and generic requirement to me.
Obviously if I was more competent in python I would be able
to knock something together, and also put it somewhere public
to save other PHP4 refugees from extra overload and confusion
when/if they start to consider python.

"search the archives"... hmm, wish I knew how to do that ?
Am I supposed to just keep looking thru all these messages
until I find the right one ?

Maybe you have not actually used PHP(4) but it is
certainly not a CMS either. It takes a lot of PHP code
to make a decent content management system... and to
be clear, my use of the meaning "PHP-like" simply means
not being an oh-so dumb and slow CGI. I am not looking
for a CMS (tho a "good" one would be nice) but some sane
python system that are not CGIs (that's going backwards
from using PHP, not forward).

mod_python + publisher is the closest I've been able to
find to PHP, so far, and looks potentially more powerful,
just missing a few of key components.

I don't know of any, but I didn't really look for it either. Using
transparent URL cookies would imply filtering the handler output though. I
don't think there are hooks for doing this in mod_python. This is must
easier done from the handler of a CMS.

I'm sorry, I was under the impression that a search option was available.

Is there an xmlrpc-handler for mod_python? Or would using
the SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler of the 2.2 SimpleXMLRPCServer
module be a natural thing to do? It just seems that Apache/mod_python
would be a more stable server solution than using SimpleXMLRPCServer
itself...

I think this is the same as:

     Alias /cgi-bin/ "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin/"

     <Directory "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin">
	 SetHandler cgi-script
         AddHandler python-program .py
         PythonHandler mptest
         PythonAuthenHandler mptest
         PythonDebug on
         AllowOverride None
         Options None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>

Off the top of my head I don't know whether AddHandler will override
SetHandler OR whichever module is envoked first (mod_python or
mod_cgi) will handler the request. You might want to try moving around
LoadModule directives in your config to see what happens.

In any event it should either work fine or not at all - why do you say
"sort of"?

Judging by your sig I take it this is on Linux?

I haven't tested any of it on Linux. I'm doing most of mp 3.0 development
on Solaris because it's got the best thread support of all os's I have
access to.

Anyhow, this message would mean that something went wrong during
compile/link - stat is a standard C library function, it shouldn't be
missing...

Sorry, this isn't being too helpful, but then this _is_ alpha code ;-)

I don't know of such a thing offhand.  Probably the best thing to do
would be to start with the SimpleXMLRPCServer code and port the
request handler to mod_python.  It probably wouldn't be that hard to
do, but it won't be a simple plug-n-play solution, either.  It's
probably only _worth_ doing if you're going to handle some serious
load.

If you can use SOAP instead of XML RPC, you can use ZSI -- it's pretty
trivial to integrate into mod_python.  On purpose.  zsi is at

I'm sure this worked for me a few days ago (maybe

to be working);

 if req._req.subprocess_env.has_key("REMOTE_ADDR"):

but now the above test is failing and when I try to

Is it possible that REMOTE_ADDR has been somehow
over written by the duplication of UNIQUE_ID and

I'm a python and mod_python novice so maybe my

Subject: [mod_python] multi-line headers in multipart/form-data
Message-ID: <59228917536.20011119221740@Vex.Net>

I found that some http clients (Opera on windows, specifically in my
tests) use multi-line headers in some mime-parts... the same way email
clients do (with whitespace leading the continued lines). mod_python's
util.py appears to not support this.

Here's my quick patch to hack around the problem for me, if anyone
else is using multipart/form-data forms.

Or maybe someone has a better hack...

Message-ID: <20011122003235.A14834@bigfoot.com>

Have anyone tried doing a HTTP POST from a form to a script running under
mod_python.cgihandler ?

I keep getting this error
python_handler: Dispatch() returned nothing.

If I disable mod_python and run this script under the CGI environment, it
works fine.

I have forgotten to include my system info.
Apache 1.3.22
modpython 2.7.6 (compiled as a DSO with a non-threaded Python 2.1.1)

Btw, the script works if I do a HTTP GET instead of a HTTP POST.

It would be hard to identify the problem without the seeing the script.
POST should work fine.

I have managed to solve the problem putting
LoadModule modules/mod_python.so 
as the last line of all the LoadModule commands and
AddModule mod_python.c
as the last line of all the AddModule commands.
This helps to kill the problem which I had previously.

Anyway, my test CGI script is very simple.

-- Start of script --
import cgi, os, sys

print 'Content-type: text/plain'
print
print os.environ()
print cgi.FieldStorage()

-- End of script --

I compiled python in /usr/local and I am using it fine from commandline and cgi, but to get this mod_python to work, I somehow need to let it know to look in /usr/local.  I figured the --with-python option would take care of that...it does find it, but I get

when compiling and in my error log when attempting to run a script.  Any thoughts?

You shouldn't need to use --with-python for this, your libpython will know
to look in /usr/local (if that's the prefix you compiled Python with,
which, BTW, is the default I think anyway)

I think your message means Apache process doesn't have persmissions to the
Python library directories.

Horray! I got the Hello World script to work.  I had to recompile python into /usr since my apache user didn't have /usr/local in the path and I wanted it in /usr anyway.  I recompiled mod_python as well and put the -DEAPI flag in the Makefile since apache kept complaining about the API config and to use this flag.  Anyway, I got it to work and I get a beautiful "hello world"

Now, what the hell do I do?  If I put another sample script (not called mptest.py but another name) in the directory where mptest.py resides, I just keep getting Hello World.  Do I have to push everything through mptest.py or what?  I am a bit confused as to how to actually do something with this mod_python.  Anyone?

Thanks for some of your suggestions. I checked security but system has full
control at modules and the specific .dll.

This is the file that is giving me headeaches:

 <<httpd.conf>> 

As in the manual I included both parts (LoadModule & <Directory>)

But when restarting Apache http server I stiil get:

"Invalid command PythonHandler, ...mispelled or module not in server
config.".

Thanks very much for any ideas (must be a simple and/or stupid mistake I
guess :)).

I had a look at your config and there is no sign of
loading up the mod_python module into apache, which
would explain the error you are seeing...

On Linux I use this in my httpd.conf...

 LoadModule python_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_python.so

If that is missing then it will definately help :)

Dear Mark,

There IS actaully in this file a line (I just copied it from it...):

LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.dll

should it be in some other place or contain an absolute path (which is not
in the manual)
or should it be:

LoadModule python_module modules\mod_python.dll (backslash)

Hi Mark,

thats right, I tried all slashes: no success

I tried all configurations here (within quotes otherwise you get other
errors like this command is taking only 2 arguments which is ok). I tried
absolute path with slashes and backslashes: no success.

I put it in the right version (checked 3 times) in the standards "modules"
directory with the right permissions within the Apache folder which is
itself also in the standard place.

As you can see above I tried all perbutations I think :)

The error log stays clean.
The access log says clean.

Restart gives exactly same result as "Test Configuration functionality.

anyway, your effort is very much appreciated, Michel

the only thing I can think of is that I have to go back to an earlier
version of Apache (1.3.20 iso 1.3.22). I am going to try that first....

In the meantime, python/win expert ideas are still welcome.....

Thanks Michel

Dear All (esp. Mark, Dan and Grisha),

I swapped Apache 1.3.22 for 1.3.20 and my problem was solved. So advice:
stick with Apache 1.3.20 on windows if you want to have an integrated Python
!

Thanks for all your help, Michel

Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python 2.7.6 + Python 2.1.1 + Windows XP professonal
works fine for me, so I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong
with Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python.

FYI
I have compiled Apache 1.3.22 and mod_python with the
current Cygwin tools

This requires changing the mod_python / src / Makefile
to link with libpython2.1.dll.a instead of libpython2.1.a

so far I downloaded binary stuff from http://www.modpython.org/dist/win/

here I only find upto version 2.7.4 !!! no binary 2.7.6 !

so...I should compile myself then ? (like others proposed already)

Sorry if I'm confusing the issue here! The release 2.7.5.tgz notes that it

Ahhh, things getting clearer now (I though the numbers shpould
correspond....)

so I will also now try to mix 2.7.4 & 2.7.6 ... (where probabl. 2.7.5
alaready solved the problem I experienced)

You also need "AddModule mod_python.c" somewhere after ClearModuleList.

Just not to confuse people any further, your problem was with your config
file. Whenever you use ClearModuleList, you have to AddModule afterwards.

This, BTW, has nothing to do with mod_python, and is all well documented
in Apache docs.

Dear Grisha,

1
It was not my intention to confuse people any further; I was just stuck and
asked for help.

2
On your second remark on the actual problem I disagree:

2.1
"Whenever you use ClearModuleList..."

I have never explicitly used it ! Ok it can be default in some config but
you suggested I added something..

2.2
"You have to AddModule".
Please show me in the manual appendix A (win install) where this is; its
just not there.

2.3
Looking at the doc it seems that AddModule is only relevant for static
links. But of course this might be me....

my reasoning: I downloaded a binary .dll so how can I reference a source
file in the httpd.conf.

2.4
I think above is true since everything seems to work fine now after the mail
I got from Ray Drew (actually combining .ddl with higher version mod_python;
thanks Ray !)

Again, sorry if I caused any incomvenience to anybody. I just come from the
structured world of Gates and now try from a more or less end-user oriented
perspective to integrate a SW infrastructure combining Apache, xalan,
xerces, cocoon, python, and some more and then our own stuff on top. I just
want to find out which problems real end-user will face when we tell them
please do this yourself....

Greetings, Michel Bohms

Dear Grischa,

I have been using mod_python for over a year now, and before that NSAPY. Many times I have developed code for mod_python that would have to be able to run as a CGI or as a script. So I wrote a bridge to handle these situations. Also I parameterized the Publisher handler and gave it transparent session handling. By breaking up this code  I acheived better control over and made the Handler easier to custimize.  Should I contribute this work to mod_python.org. If so, how?  I will galdly tidy it up and document it. Also my version of the Publisher has most of your code just lifted in, then slightly re-worked. I will be happy to have your recomendations regarding the wording of the copyright etc.

Thank you very much. You can simply e-mail it to me - we will then review
it and if all is well, add it to the future releases of mod_python.

hello,

first i tried the PythonImport directive to preload modules setting up a
db connection pool.  but the connections were dead when i tried to use
them.

second, i tried modifying the sitecustomize module which gets imported
from the site module at interpreter startup (supposedly).  this gave me
good connections, but it doesn't happen until the first page gets loaded.

i'd like to stuff some pretty time-consuming setup tasks into this phase
of startup... it should already be done when the first page is requested.

any ideas?

You might try forcing everything to run under the main insterpreter by
sticking

PythonInterpreter main_interpreter

somehwere in httpd.conf. This way PythonImport (which only runs under main
insterpreter) and everything else will run in one interpreter and you
should see the connections (may be).

PythonImport is a flaky directive for a couple of reasons. First, there is
the subinterpreter problem. Second, the apache startup is a bit more
complicated than one may think, at the time when PythonImport is executed
(which is at child initialization time), the config has not yet been
parsed (or rather it has, but the child has no access to it yet).

The bottom line is your mileage may vary with PythonImport.

Subject: [mod_python] Current working directory
Message-ID: <20011102173647.E20474@vestdata.no>

Hi

How does the current working directory get set when working with
mod_python?

The problem is that my handler (and modules imported by the handler) is
trying to access local files, but it can't find them because the current
directory is not set "properly". 

I tried adding os.chdir() in my handler, but it seems the cwd is still
random for modules imported from my handler.

Maybe someone could shed some light on this?

I think the best thing would be that the directory of the handler would
be the cwd both when importing the handler and other modules, but if I
could only set it manually that would also be ok.

Thanks.

mod_python doesn't change the current directory, so it's whatever apache
happens to have as cwd, probably the dir from which it was started.

really old versions used to behave exactly as you say, but this had to be
removed, because changing cwd is not a thread-safe operation.

my recommendation is to avoid chdir() and use full paths

I implemented a very simple session module which mostly works --- it
worked well enough for the task I had at the time. It generates an
opaque session identifier which corresponds to the name of a file on
disk containing pickled session data.

As I look at it now, it isn't robust in the face of multiple clients
sharing the session id, but as I said it was written in about twenty
minutes for an internal app.

Are there any decent ones? I remember doing a brief search and not
finding anything I immediately liked.

I'd certainly be interested in tossing my code over the fence as the
seed for a more robust session manager.

I wrote a session manager for my project dubbed Python.ASP. (It is an ASP
like but far more powerfull active server page framework using python as the
scripting language.) The session manager uses a hybrid cookie/url mechanism
to pass a session id which is used to store and retrieve the database backed
session data. It also performs robot detection. The project is finished but
I won't have time to document it, write an installation procedure and
release it for some time. The session module is somewhat difficult to lift
out of the ASP framework, but if you want to take a look at the code,
contact me by mail and I'll send it to you.

Subject: [mod_python] Redirect from publisher?
Message-ID: <20011106125013.A687@tyche.svt.tu-harburg.de>

Some of my mod_python.publisher functions want to redirect the client to
another URL under certain conditions (e.g. redirect from a secure server
to an insecure or vice versa).

Do you consider this a bad idea?

My first approach would be to let the publisher function set an
attribute of the request object and return nothing, so that a special
handler (called after the publisher) can do the redirect (as described
in the FAQ). What do you think?

TIA

If there is a way to search the archive for my answer, please
direct me to that.

My question is, what are the security options with mod_python? For
example, running python through CGI scripts allows the system owner to
wrap the script with cgiwrap, sbox, suexec or some other thing that can
make the program run with the permission of the owner, and not with
permission of Apache, so as to prevent users from hurting each other or
the system.

The mod_php partially answers this with "safe mode" and "openbasedir" that
govern what file activities a PHP script is allowed to do like
opening for reading (though everything still runs as apache).

Does mod_python have something similar to or better than "safe mode"? If
you are running mod_python can any user on the system write a python
script that can do anything the webserver has permission to do?

Thanks for any help,

Allen

Hi,

I'm happily playing with mod_python 2.76 on Redhat 7.2. First I'd like to
say thanks for the docs. They're very well written -- I only wish you'd
written a whole book instead. :-) I'm looking forward to writing a customer
application in it.

I'm using mod_python.publisher to allow URL-level access to functions inside
a module, and I want to test protection of a function by prefixing its name
with an underscore. So first I set up httpd.conf with these lines:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

Then I entered this into the module, myscript.py:

from mod_python import apache

def _blah(req):

    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("Uh oh, you shouldn't be seeing this...")

    return apache

So when I go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1/myscript.py/blah", I get varying
results each time I reload the page. Sometimes I just get the "Uh oh" line
of text, other times I get the line of text plus Apache's version & modules
info, plus an Apache internal error message. If I remove the underscore, it
behaves as it should, just giving me the line of text.

Did I misunderstand this whole underscore thing?

Also, I may have a correction for the docs. In section 3.4, in the feedback
form HTML, in order to get the demo to work I had to change the action
element to read:

<form action="form.py/email" method="POST">

Was this just a doc mistake, or does it indicate that something is different
about my setup?

Finally, RH comes with threaded Python. What are the potential problems
stemming from this?

Thanks for your help!

Yes, pretty much.

I'm not familiar with what PHP does, though at first glance this looks
like semi-security - if the process still runs as the httpd user, there's
probably still a great risk of someone finding a way around the barriers
PHP imposes... But then again I don't know first thing about it.

Apache 2.0 should have a native solution to this problem
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/perchild.html), so there is probably
no point in trying to engineer something through mod_python, especially
considering I have no control over the actual Python interpreter code
itself (unlike the PHP people).

In this case the cwd is different every time - seems to change with the
last object accessed by that particular child.

I don't understand this, because AFAIK there are no threads involved!

full paths is not an option, because the same source-code is checked out
of CVS into multiple directories.

I suppose I can use __file__ to generate the full path, but it seems
hackish.

Not sure I understand why you need a special handler for it, something
like this should work with the publisher:

     req.headers_out['location'] = 'http://www.modpython.org/'
     req.status = apache.HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY
     return "You are being redirected to http://www.modpython.org/"

Message-ID: <003401c1677b$d4c9ae30$fd01a8c0@mixio7jpsmlatx>

Hi all,

This mail is basically intended for developpers of  NT or W2K -based 
web applications who are willing to test win+Python as a web platform
or have difficulties in running their mod_python apps under windows.

Just wanted to post a few words to say how great mod_python is and
share a bit of code...

As far we are concerned, this works great and fast.  
Our current development combination is:
- WIN2K server,
- apache 1.3
- mod_python,
- python
- mxodbc for db connectivity.

This combo works great for database-app applications requiring a lot of buffered 
databased-informations intensive sql querying.

It took us less than 2 months to do switch a whole demanding app from 
ms-tool based development on winK2 to apache+mod_python on winK2  .... 
including learning python, a short and enjoyable experience :)

The result is great and fast as all demanding queries are buffered in
global dictionnaries. The only problems we have encoutered are :
- threading,
- threading,
- threading.

Python is threaded, apache-win is threaded .. Be aware that
your mod_python code should also be. 

It took us A COUPLE OF WEEKS to grasp pbs that occured in 
demanding race-conditions and then solve them. 

This is the reason for this mail. Intended for those with limited
skills with thread. Programming data-intensive python+mod_python apps 
on win32 is an easy game including for programmers with limited IT background. 

BUT it is imperative to code threadsafe when coding wK2+apache+mod_python.

For those with no experience with building threadsafe code
applications (possibly the case if you work with interpreted languages),
a few recommendations for mod_python:
1) use as few globals as possible,
pass over your "state-variables" as local python objects and keep
shared variables to the absolute mimimum.

2) make sure to avoid race-conditions on those globals

if you need global (you will if you want high perfs - to store buffered database output), 
make sure those global variables are updated in a tight block of code with a lock
to prevent concurrent threads to access "shared info" whilst this
information is beeing updated

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe mod_python code:

##################################
# in mod_python init code
global_data_lock = threading.RLock()

##################################
# in your mod_python code
# run when needed
global global_data_lock 
global_data_lock.acquire()
try:
   # load or update your shared data .. dictionnaries and al
   load_shared_data()
finally:
   global_data_lock.release()

 
3 ) odbc connectivy (thru mxodbc) may or not be threadsafe

Encapsulate your odbc connections in a "pool" of connections
with round-robin access to them through a shared queue
(a "webwarish" bit of code, my thanks to webware, 
a great tool we'd like to investigate soon)

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe odbc python :

#################################
# in mod_python init code
# build a series of sleeping odbc connections
NB_CONNECTIONS = 20
connection_queue = Queue()
for each_value in range(NB_CONNECTIONS):
  database_handle = ODBC.Windows.Connect('my_dsn','my_user','my_password',0)
  connection_queue.put(database_handle) 

##################################
# in your database code
# use them in round-robin
# every time
global connection_queue
database_handle = connection_queue.get()
cursor_handle = database_handle.cursor()
cursor_handle.execute("SELECT * FROM DUMMY")
connection_queue.put(database_handle)

mod_python on win32 rocks!

Thanks for your answer. It's what I needed to know.

I looked at the MPM stuff in Apache 2.0 and it looks like you need to
specify "AssignUserId" in a <VirtualHost> container of the httpd.conf
file. That sort of defeats the purpose of mod_vhost_alias which let you
make a directory and be on your way with a new virtual host.

Since Apache 2.0 will be capable of changing the UID of the child
process anyway, it would have been great if they could just make the
child process the same UID as the file that was about to be served.

That would fix mod_php and mod_python so that user's scripts can only do
what that user can do. No need to change httpd.conf and restart apache
every time you get a new user.

Allen

	Is there a way to store data, like sessions, persistantly accross all 
backends? In other words, if I set a variable it will remain persistant for 
the one apache backend (right?), but will it remain visible to other backends?

	Also, if anyone has any experience with other session modules, I would 
appreciate input. I would prefer that it be stable, and somewhat scalable 
(for concurrent access). I know a few exist, but the "Vaults of Parnassus" 
don't seem to contain many such modules.

A sneak preview of Python.ASP can be found at:
http://www.boskant.nl/geert/python.asp-PREVIEW.tar.gz

I noticed I wrote a document on session management! It is in the archive
too.

DISCLAIMER: There is no documenatation yet, and neither an install
procedure. You need mysql to run it. You also need the latest mod_python 2.X
CVS to run it. (or search the mod_python archives for my patch). And there
is a performance drain I didn't find yet. Oh well... have fun! ;)

Message-ID: <B80F654F.8C16%sflist@ihonk.com>

Hi,

I'm happily playing with mod_python 2.76 on Redhat 7.2. First I'd like to
say thanks for the docs. They're very well written -- I only wish you'd
written a whole book instead. :-) I'm looking forward to writing a customer
application in it.

I'm using mod_python.publisher to allow URL-level access to functions inside
a module, and I want to test protection of a function by prefixing its name
with an underscore. So first I set up httpd.conf with these lines:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

Then I entered this into the module, myscript.py:

from mod_python import apache

def _blah(req):

    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("Uh oh, you shouldn't be seeing this...")

    return apache

So when I go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1/myscript.py/blah", I get varying
results each time I reload the page. Sometimes I just get the "Uh oh" line
of text, other times I get the line of text plus Apache's version & modules
info, plus an Apache internal error message. If I remove the underscore, it
behaves as it should, just giving me the line of text.

Did I misunderstand this whole underscore thing?

Also, I may have a correction for the docs. In section 3.4, in the feedback
form HTML, in order to get the demo to work I had to change the action
element to read:

<form action="form.py/email" method="POST">

Was this just a doc mistake, or does it indicate that something is different
about my setup?

Finally, RH comes with threaded Python. What are the potential problems
stemming from this?

Thanks for your help!

Hello list!

I want to build a web app in Python to handle database transactions.

The system is SuSE 7.2 (kernel 2.4.4), apache 1.3.19, mysql 2.23.38,
mod_python 2.7.6, python 2.1.1. All packages were compiled and installed.

After httpd start following message occurs:

Though I'm kind of surprised you were getting anything at all, you were
supposed to get "not found" or "forbidden". Make sure your config says

PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

You can try defining -DEAPI by editing src/Makefile, then doing make
clean; make. But I doubt that this is the problem.

I'd try running mod_python without some of the other modules running, to
see if there a complict of some sort.

Hello,

I have just compiled ModPython-2.7.6 for Apache-1.3.22 on Debian Linux
(version 2.2 enhanced with a lot of packages -- including Apache -- picked
from the upcoming 3.0 distribution). On loading ModPython DSO, the Apache
server warns about a possible crash if it was compiled without the -DEAPI
option. Passing this option to gcc in src/Makefile apparently solves the
issue. (It is actually used inside apxs, but apxs is used for linking of
the final DSO only, not for compiling the C sources). Should we install
this modification to src/Makefile? (This option would probably do no harm
in case of older Apache servers which do not support EAPI)?

As fas as I understand, if Apache didn't crash immediately after or even
before issuing the EAPI warning, then you're using one of those C
compliers (gcc probably) that fill missing parts of strucures with NULLs
and you're safe.

But if the warning bothers you, you can add OPTS=-DEAPI in src Makefile.
Other than suppressing the warning, it will have no effect whatsover.

The issue is not that parts are missing, but that the structure changed
size.

You got lucky.  It might be you got lucky all the time, it might be you
got lucky each time the program started.

It's like this.  Create a file foo.c:
	char buf[4] = { 'h', 'i', 't', 't' };
	int x = 1234;
Create a file bar.c
	#include <stdio.h>
	extern char buf[8];
	int main(int ac, char **av) {
		printf("%s\n", buf);
		return 0;
	}
Compile and run
	cc foo.c bar.c ; ./a.out

It all depends on how your compiler and linker and operating system lay
out the data.

The ONLY safe thing to do is compile ALL your modules with -DEAPI

It does say that, so I guess it's behaving wrongly. Anything I can do to

I don't know a heck of a lot about windows... but you might try looking at 
httpd.conf (or whatever the main apache configuration file is called). You 
need to somewhere load the python module (using the LoadModule command) in 
order for apaceh to recognize that command. That assumes that you built 
mod_python as a dynamic shared object.

Please send along a little more info about your problem:
1) how did you build mod_python (is it a shared object or built into apache)?
2) show the pieces of httpd.conf that are supposed to initialize the python 
module (i.e. point to the library you built).
3) what troubleshooting have you already tried (I don't know "everything in 
this list")?

i changed my scriptalias section to something like this...

    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin/"

    <Directory "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin">
        AddHandler python-program .py
        PythonHandler mptest
        PythonAuthenHandler mptest
        PythonDebug on
        AllowOverride None
        Options None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

and placed the mptest.py inside cgi-bin folder... it (sort of) works fine...

is there something wrong with this?????


just curious... ;)

I'm a refugee from PHP4 and would really like to
use something the equivalent of PHP4s sessions ?

I've spent hours going thru the mail archives and
there seems to be some reluctance (?) to accumulate
mod_python examples, or something... they're really
hard to find and essential when trying to learn python
itself, and how it fits in with mod_python, and keeping
the peace between 1.5, 2.0, 2.1 and... 

Surely there is a site out there that specializes in
mod_python scripts ? I assumed modpython.org would
have heaps of examples, but nada except the handlers
included in the package itself. Strange.

Maybe there is a lack of interest because mod_python is thought to be on a
lower level than PHP. I see mod_python as apache/python integration
software, not as a e-content system. There are no templates, no sessions,
there is no standard library. These of course can all be built on top of
mod_python, but there is (not yet) a standard content system that is
regarded as _the_ content system for mod_python. [yes, I know the publisher,
but I don't consider that to be a full blown e-content system]

Sessions, for example, would require a database to back the session data,
something that is out of scope for mod_python. Also templates would be
handy.

AFAIK there is some software (webware, cheetah, ...) out there that builds
on mod_python but I didn't like it. That's why I wrote my own e-content
system. If you seach the archives you'll find a link to a preview version of
it.

I agree with you that this distinction should be made more clear. IMHO
mod_python is _not_ an e-content system. It is not a PHP.

Sessions require much more than just a few lines of code.

I don't expect it to be either and I'm not really after
someone elses idea of what a CMS should be, but various
low(ish) level components like a generic sessions system
written by people far more experienced in python than me
would give me more confidence that something so close to
authentication is done right.

I'm after a PHP4 sessions clone, persistant store in /tmp
and fallback to transparent URL if cookies are not available.

Anyone out there know of any such beast ?

This seems like a rather simple and generic requirement to me.
Obviously if I was more competent in python I would be able
to knock something together, and also put it somewhere public
to save other PHP4 refugees from extra overload and confusion
when/if they start to consider python.

"search the archives"... hmm, wish I knew how to do that ?
Am I supposed to just keep looking thru all these messages
until I find the right one ?

Maybe you have not actually used PHP(4) but it is
certainly not a CMS either. It takes a lot of PHP code
to make a decent content management system... and to
be clear, my use of the meaning "PHP-like" simply means
not being an oh-so dumb and slow CGI. I am not looking
for a CMS (tho a "good" one would be nice) but some sane
python system that are not CGIs (that's going backwards
from using PHP, not forward).

mod_python + publisher is the closest I've been able to
find to PHP, so far, and looks potentially more powerful,
just missing a few of key components.

I don't know of any, but I didn't really look for it either. Using
transparent URL cookies would imply filtering the handler output though. I
don't think there are hooks for doing this in mod_python. This is must
easier done from the handler of a CMS.

Is there an xmlrpc-handler for mod_python? Or would using
the SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler of the 2.2 SimpleXMLRPCServer
module be a natural thing to do? It just seems that Apache/mod_python
would be a more stable server solution than using SimpleXMLRPCServer
itself...

I think this is the same as:

     Alias /cgi-bin/ "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin/"

     <Directory "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin">
	 SetHandler cgi-script
         AddHandler python-program .py
         PythonHandler mptest
         PythonAuthenHandler mptest
         PythonDebug on
         AllowOverride None
         Options None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>

Off the top of my head I don't know whether AddHandler will override
SetHandler OR whichever module is envoked first (mod_python or
mod_cgi) will handler the request. You might want to try moving around
LoadModule directives in your config to see what happens.

In any event it should either work fine or not at all - why do you say
"sort of"?

Judging by your sig I take it this is on Linux?

I haven't tested any of it on Linux. I'm doing most of mp 3.0 development
on Solaris because it's got the best thread support of all os's I have
access to.

Anyhow, this message would mean that something went wrong during
compile/link - stat is a standard C library function, it shouldn't be
missing...

Sorry, this isn't being too helpful, but then this _is_ alpha code ;-)

I don't know of such a thing offhand.  Probably the best thing to do
would be to start with the SimpleXMLRPCServer code and port the
request handler to mod_python.  It probably wouldn't be that hard to
do, but it won't be a simple plug-n-play solution, either.  It's
probably only _worth_ doing if you're going to handle some serious
load.

If you can use SOAP instead of XML RPC, you can use ZSI -- it's pretty
trivial to integrate into mod_python.  On purpose.  zsi is at

I'm sure this worked for me a few days ago (maybe
I was imaginging it and some rotuine nearby happened
to be working);

 if req._req.subprocess_env.has_key("REMOTE_ADDR"):
   rn = req._req.subprocess_env["REMOTE_ADDR"]

but now the above test is failing and when I try to
see where REMOTE_ADDR has gone I get these results...

 for k in req._req.subprocess_env.keys():

UNIQUE_ID
WE_HAVE_REWRITE
GATEWAY_INTERFACE

Is it possible that REMOTE_ADDR has been somehow
over written by the duplication of UNIQUE_ID and
WE_HAVE_REWRITE ?

I'm a python and mod_python novice so maybe my
question should be simply "how do I find REMOTE_ADDR
under mod_python" ?

I found that some http clients (Opera on windows, specifically in my

clients do (with whitespace leading the continued lines). mod_python's
util.py appears to not support this.

Here's my quick patch to hack around the problem for me, if anyone

Subject: [mod_python] HTTP POST in mod_python.cgihandler
Message-ID: <20011122003235.A14834@bigfoot.com>

Have anyone tried doing a HTTP POST from a form to a script running under
mod_python.cgihandler ?

I keep getting this error
python_handler: Dispatch() returned nothing.

If I disable mod_python and run this script under the CGI environment, it
works fine.

I have forgotten to include my system info.
Apache 1.3.22
modpython 2.7.6 (compiled as a DSO with a non-threaded Python 2.1.1)

Btw, the script works if I do a HTTP GET instead of a HTTP POST.

It would be hard to identify the problem without the seeing the script.
POST should work fine.

I have managed to solve the problem putting
LoadModule modules/mod_python.so 
as the last line of all the LoadModule commands and
AddModule mod_python.c
as the last line of all the AddModule commands.
This helps to kill the problem which I had previously.

Anyway, my test CGI script is very simple.

-- Start of script --
import cgi, os, sys

print 'Content-type: text/plain'
print
print os.environ()
print cgi.FieldStorage()

-- End of script --

I compiled python in /usr/local and I am using it fine from commandline and cgi, but to get this mod_python to work, I somehow need to let it know to look in /usr/local.  I figured the --with-python option would take care of that...it does find it, but I get 

'import site' failed; use -v for traceback

when compiling and in my error log when attempting to run a script.  Any thoughts?

You shouldn't need to use --with-python for this, your libpython will know
to look in /usr/local (if that's the prefix you compiled Python with,
which, BTW, is the default I think anyway)

I think your message means Apache process doesn't have persmissions to the
Python library directories.

Horray! I got the Hello World script to work.  I had to recompile python into /usr since my apache user didn't have /usr/local in the path and I wanted it in /usr anyway.  I recompiled mod_python as well and put the -DEAPI flag in the Makefile since apache kept complaining about the API config and to use this flag.  Anyway, I got it to work and I get a beautiful "hello world"

Now, what the hell do I do?  If I put another sample script (not called mptest.py but another name) in the directory where mptest.py resides, I just keep getting Hello World.  Do I have to push everything through mptest.py or what?  I am a bit confused as to how to actually do something with this mod_python.  Anyone?

Thanks for some of your suggestions. I checked security but system has full
control at modules and the specific .dll.

This is the file that is giving me headeaches:

 <<httpd.conf>> 

As in the manual I included both parts (LoadModule & <Directory>)

But when restarting Apache http server I stiil get:

"Invalid command PythonHandler, ...mispelled or module not in server
config.".

Thanks very much for any ideas (must be a simple and/or stupid mistake I
guess :)).

I had a look at your config and there is no sign of
loading up the mod_python module into apache, which
would explain the error you are seeing...

On Linux I use this in my httpd.conf...

 LoadModule python_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_python.so

If that is missing then it will definately help :)

Dear Mark,

There IS actaully in this file a line (I just copied it from it...):

LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.dll

should it be in some other place or contain an absolute path (which is not
in the manual)
or should it be:

LoadModule python_module modules\mod_python.dll (backslash)

Hi Mark,

thats right, I tried all slashes: no success

I tried all configurations here (within quotes otherwise you get other
errors like this command is taking only 2 arguments which is ok). I tried
absolute path with slashes and backslashes: no success.

I put it in the right version (checked 3 times) in the standards "modules"
directory with the right permissions within the Apache folder which is
itself also in the standard place.

As you can see above I tried all perbutations I think :)

The error log stays clean.
The access log says clean.

Restart gives exactly same result as "Test Configuration functionality.

anyway, your effort is very much appreciated, Michel

the only thing I can think of is that I have to go back to an earlier
version of Apache (1.3.20 iso 1.3.22). I am going to try that first....

In the meantime, python/win expert ideas are still welcome.....

Thanks Michel

Dear All (esp. Mark, Dan and Grisha),

I swapped Apache 1.3.22 for 1.3.20 and my problem was solved. So advice:
stick with Apache 1.3.20 on windows if you want to have an integrated Python
!

Thanks for all your help, Michel

Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python 2.7.6 + Python 2.1.1 + Windows XP professonal
works fine for me, so I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong
with Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python.

FYI
I have compiled Apache 1.3.22 and mod_python with the
current Cygwin tools

This requires changing the mod_python / src / Makefile
to link with libpython2.1.dll.a instead of libpython2.1.a

Cheers

Ahhh, things getting clearer now (I though the numbers shpould
correspond....)

so I will also now try to mix 2.7.4 & 2.7.6 ... (where probabl. 2.7.5
alaready solved the problem I experienced)

You also need "AddModule mod_python.c" somewhere after ClearModuleList.

Just not to confuse people any further, your problem was with your config
file. Whenever you use ClearModuleList, you have to AddModule afterwards.

This, BTW, has nothing to do with mod_python, and is all well documented
in Apache docs.

Dear Grisha,

1
It was not my intention to confuse people any further; I was just stuck and
asked for help.

2
On your second remark on the actual problem I disagree:

2.1
"Whenever you use ClearModuleList..."

I have never explicitly used it ! Ok it can be default in some config but
you suggested I added something..

2.2
"You have to AddModule".
Please show me in the manual appendix A (win install) where this is; its
just not there.

2.3
Looking at the doc it seems that AddModule is only relevant for static
links. But of course this might be me....

my reasoning: I downloaded a binary .dll so how can I reference a source
file in the httpd.conf.

2.4
I think above is true since everything seems to work fine now after the mail
I got from Ray Drew (actually combining .ddl with higher version mod_python;
thanks Ray !)

Again, sorry if I caused any incomvenience to anybody. I just come from the
structured world of Gates and now try from a more or less end-user oriented
perspective to integrate a SW infrastructure combining Apache, xalan,
xerces, cocoon, python, and some more and then our own stuff on top. I just
want to find out which problems real end-user will face when we tell them
please do this yourself....

Dear Grischa,

I have been using mod_python for over a year now, and before that NSAPY. Many times I have developed code for mod_python that would have to be able to run as a CGI or as a script. So I wrote a bridge to handle these situations. Also I parameterized the Publisher handler and gave it transparent session handling. By breaking up this code  I acheived better control over and made the Handler easier to custimize.  Should I contribute this work to mod_python.org. If so, how?  I will galdly tidy it up and document it. Also my version of the Publisher has most of your code just lifted in, then slightly re-worked. I will be happy to have your recomendations regarding the wording of the copyright etc.

Thank you very much. You can simply e-mail it to me - we will then review
it and if all is well, add it to the future releases of mod_python.

first i tried the PythonImport directive to preload modules setting up a

second, i tried modifying the sitecustomize module which gets imported

good connections, but it doesn't happen until the first page gets loaded.

i'd like to stuff some pretty time-consuming setup tasks into this phase

any ideas?

You might try forcing everything to run under the main insterpreter by
sticking

PythonInterpreter main_interpreter

somehwere in httpd.conf. This way PythonImport (which only runs under main
insterpreter) and everything else will run in one interpreter and you
should see the connections (may be).

PythonImport is a flaky directive for a couple of reasons. First, there is
the subinterpreter problem. Second, the apache startup is a bit more
complicated than one may think, at the time when PythonImport is executed
(which is at child initialization time), the config has not yet been
parsed (or rather it has, but the child has no access to it yet).

The bottom line is your mileage may vary with PythonImport.

Subject: [mod_python] Current working directory
Message-ID: <20011102173647.E20474@vestdata.no>

Hi

How does the current working directory get set when working with
mod_python?

The problem is that my handler (and modules imported by the handler) is
trying to access local files, but it can't find them because the current
directory is not set "properly". 

I tried adding os.chdir() in my handler, but it seems the cwd is still
random for modules imported from my handler.

Maybe someone could shed some light on this?

I think the best thing would be that the directory of the handler would
be the cwd both when importing the handler and other modules, but if I
could only set it manually that would also be ok.

Thanks.

mod_python doesn't change the current directory, so it's whatever apache
happens to have as cwd, probably the dir from which it was started.

really old versions used to behave exactly as you say, but this had to be
removed, because changing cwd is not a thread-safe operation.

my recommendation is to avoid chdir() and use full paths

I implemented a very simple session module which mostly works --- it
worked well enough for the task I had at the time. It generates an
opaque session identifier which corresponds to the name of a file on
disk containing pickled session data.

As I look at it now, it isn't robust in the face of multiple clients
sharing the session id, but as I said it was written in about twenty
minutes for an internal app.

Are there any decent ones? I remember doing a brief search and not
finding anything I immediately liked.

I'd certainly be interested in tossing my code over the fence as the
seed for a more robust session manager.

I wrote a session manager for my project dubbed Python.ASP. (It is an ASP
like but far more powerfull active server page framework using python as the
scripting language.) The session manager uses a hybrid cookie/url mechanism
to pass a session id which is used to store and retrieve the database backed
session data. It also performs robot detection. The project is finished but
I won't have time to document it, write an installation procedure and
release it for some time. The session module is somewhat difficult to lift
out of the ASP framework, but if you want to take a look at the code,
contact me by mail and I'll send it to you.

Subject: [mod_python] Redirect from publisher?
Message-ID: <20011106125013.A687@tyche.svt.tu-harburg.de>

Some of my mod_python.publisher functions want to redirect the client to
another URL under certain conditions (e.g. redirect from a secure server
to an insecure or vice versa).

Do you consider this a bad idea?

My first approach would be to let the publisher function set an
attribute of the request object and return nothing, so that a special
handler (called after the publisher) can do the redirect (as described
in the FAQ). What do you think?

If there is a way to search the archive for my answer, please
direct me to that.

My question is, what are the security options with mod_python? For
example, running python through CGI scripts allows the system owner to
wrap the script with cgiwrap, sbox, suexec or some other thing that can
make the program run with the permission of the owner, and not with
permission of Apache, so as to prevent users from hurting each other or
the system.

The mod_php partially answers this with "safe mode" and "openbasedir" that
govern what file activities a PHP script is allowed to do like
opening for reading (though everything still runs as apache).

Does mod_python have something similar to or better than "safe mode"? If
you are running mod_python can any user on the system write a python
script that can do anything the webserver has permission to do?

Thanks for any help,

Allen

Hi,

I'm happily playing with mod_python 2.76 on Redhat 7.2. First I'd like to
say thanks for the docs. They're very well written -- I only wish you'd
written a whole book instead. :-) I'm looking forward to writing a customer
application in it.

I'm using mod_python.publisher to allow URL-level access to functions inside
a module, and I want to test protection of a function by prefixing its name
with an underscore. So first I set up httpd.conf with these lines:

AddHandler python-program .py
PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

Then I entered this into the module, myscript.py:

from mod_python import apache

def _blah(req):

    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("Uh oh, you shouldn't be seeing this...")

    return apache

So when I go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1/myscript.py/blah", I get varying
results each time I reload the page. Sometimes I just get the "Uh oh" line
of text, other times I get the line of text plus Apache's version & modules
info, plus an Apache internal error message. If I remove the underscore, it
behaves as it should, just giving me the line of text.

Did I misunderstand this whole underscore thing?

Also, I may have a correction for the docs. In section 3.4, in the feedback
form HTML, in order to get the demo to work I had to change the action
element to read:

<form action="form.py/email" method="POST">

Was this just a doc mistake, or does it indicate that something is different
about my setup?

Finally, RH comes with threaded Python. What are the potential problems
stemming from this?

Thanks for your help!

Yes, pretty much.

I'm not familiar with what PHP does, though at first glance this looks
like semi-security - if the process still runs as the httpd user, there's
probably still a great risk of someone finding a way around the barriers
PHP imposes... But then again I don't know first thing about it.

Apache 2.0 should have a native solution to this problem
(http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/perchild.html), so there is probably
no point in trying to engineer something through mod_python, especially
considering I have no control over the actual Python interpreter code
itself (unlike the PHP people).

In this case the cwd is different every time - seems to change with the
last object accessed by that particular child.

I don't understand this, because AFAIK there are no threads involved!

full paths is not an option, because the same source-code is checked out
of CVS into multiple directories.

I suppose I can use __file__ to generate the full path, but it seems
hackish.

Not sure I understand why you need a special handler for it, something
like this should work with the publisher:

     req.headers_out['location'] = 'http://www.modpython.org/'
     req.status = apache.HTTP_MOVED_TEMPORARILY
     return "You are being redirected to http://www.modpython.org/"

Message-ID: <003401c1677b$d4c9ae30$fd01a8c0@mixio7jpsmlatx>

Hi all,

This mail is basically intended for developpers of  NT or W2K -based 
web applications who are willing to test win+Python as a web platform
or have difficulties in running their mod_python apps under windows.

Just wanted to post a few words to say how great mod_python is and
share a bit of code...

As far we are concerned, this works great and fast.  
Our current development combination is:
- WIN2K server,
- apache 1.3
- mod_python,
- python
- mxodbc for db connectivity.

This combo works great for database-app applications requiring a lot of buffered 
databased-informations intensive sql querying.

It took us less than 2 months to do switch a whole demanding app from 
ms-tool based development on winK2 to apache+mod_python on winK2  .... 
including learning python, a short and enjoyable experience :)

The result is great and fast as all demanding queries are buffered in
global dictionnaries. The only problems we have encoutered are :
- threading,
- threading,
- threading.

Python is threaded, apache-win is threaded .. Be aware that
your mod_python code should also be. 

It took us A COUPLE OF WEEKS to grasp pbs that occured in 
demanding race-conditions and then solve them. 

This is the reason for this mail. Intended for those with limited
skills with thread. Programming data-intensive python+mod_python apps 
on win32 is an easy game including for programmers with limited IT background. 

BUT it is imperative to code threadsafe when coding wK2+apache+mod_python.

For those with no experience with building threadsafe code
applications (possibly the case if you work with interpreted languages),
a few recommendations for mod_python:
1) use as few globals as possible,
pass over your "state-variables" as local python objects and keep
shared variables to the absolute mimimum.

2) make sure to avoid race-conditions on those globals

if you need global (you will if you want high perfs - to store buffered database output), 
make sure those global variables are updated in a tight block of code with a lock
to prevent concurrent threads to access "shared info" whilst this
information is beeing updated

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe mod_python code:

##################################
# in mod_python init code
global_data_lock = threading.RLock()

##################################
# in your mod_python code
# run when needed
global global_data_lock 
global_data_lock.acquire()
try:
   # load or update your shared data .. dictionnaries and al
   load_shared_data()
finally:
   global_data_lock.release()

 
3 ) odbc connectivy (thru mxodbc) may or not be threadsafe

Encapsulate your odbc connections in a "pool" of connections
with round-robin access to them through a shared queue
(a "webwarish" bit of code, my thanks to webware, 
a great tool we'd like to investigate soon)

The kind of python code that helped us build threadsafe odbc python :

#################################
# in mod_python init code
# build a series of sleeping odbc connections
NB_CONNECTIONS = 20
connection_queue = Queue()
for each_value in range(NB_CONNECTIONS):
  database_handle = ODBC.Windows.Connect('my_dsn','my_user','my_password',0)
  connection_queue.put(database_handle) 

##################################
# in your database code
# use them in round-robin
# every time
global connection_queue
database_handle = connection_queue.get()
cursor_handle = database_handle.cursor()
cursor_handle.execute("SELECT * FROM DUMMY")
connection_queue.put(database_handle)

mod_python on win32 rocks!

Thanks for your answer. It's what I needed to know.

I looked at the MPM stuff in Apache 2.0 and it looks like you need to
specify "AssignUserId" in a <VirtualHost> container of the httpd.conf
file. That sort of defeats the purpose of mod_vhost_alias which let you
make a directory and be on your way with a new virtual host.

Since Apache 2.0 will be capable of changing the UID of the child
process anyway, it would have been great if they could just make the
child process the same UID as the file that was about to be served.

That would fix mod_php and mod_python so that user's scripts can only do
what that user can do. No need to change httpd.conf and restart apache
every time you get a new user.

the one apache backend (right?), but will it remain visible to other backends?

	Also, if anyone has any experience with other session modules, I would 
appreciate input. I would prefer that it be stable, and somewhat scalable 
(for concurrent access). I know a few exist, but the "Vaults of Parnassus"

A sneak preview of Python.ASP can be found at:

I noticed I wrote a document on session management! It is in the archive
too.

DISCLAIMER: There is no documenatation yet, and neither an install
procedure. You need mysql to run it. You also need the latest mod_python 2.X
CVS to run it. (or search the mod_python archives for my patch). And there
is a performance drain I didn't find yet. Oh well... have fun! ;)

Though I'm kind of surprised you were getting anything at all, you were
supposed to get "not found" or "forbidden". Make sure your config says

PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

You can try defining -DEAPI by editing src/Makefile, then doing make
clean; make. But I doubt that this is the problem.

I'd try running mod_python without some of the other modules running, to
see if there a complict of some sort.

Hello,

I have just compiled ModPython-2.7.6 for Apache-1.3.22 on Debian Linux
(version 2.2 enhanced with a lot of packages -- including Apache -- picked
from the upcoming 3.0 distribution). On loading ModPython DSO, the Apache
server warns about a possible crash if it was compiled without the -DEAPI
option. Passing this option to gcc in src/Makefile apparently solves the
issue. (It is actually used inside apxs, but apxs is used for linking of
the final DSO only, not for compiling the C sources). Should we install
this modification to src/Makefile? (This option would probably do no harm
in case of older Apache servers which do not support EAPI)?

As fas as I understand, if Apache didn't crash immediately after or even
before issuing the EAPI warning, then you're using one of those C
compliers (gcc probably) that fill missing parts of strucures with NULLs
and you're safe.

But if the warning bothers you, you can add OPTS=-DEAPI in src Makefile.
Other than suppressing the warning, it will have no effect whatsover.

The issue is not that parts are missing, but that the structure changed
size.

You got lucky.  It might be you got lucky all the time, it might be you
got lucky each time the program started.

It's like this.  Create a file foo.c:
	char buf[4] = { 'h', 'i', 't', 't' };
	int x = 1234;
Create a file bar.c
	#include <stdio.h>
	extern char buf[8];
	int main(int ac, char **av) {
		printf("%s\n", buf);
		return 0;
	}
Compile and run
	cc foo.c bar.c ; ./a.out

It all depends on how your compiler and linker and operating system lay
out the data.

The ONLY safe thing to do is compile ALL your modules with -DEAPI

It does say that, so I guess it's behaving wrongly. Anything I can do to
troubleshoot?

I don't know a heck of a lot about windows... but you might try looking at 
httpd.conf (or whatever the main apache configuration file is called). You 
need to somewhere load the python module (using the LoadModule command) in 
order for apaceh to recognize that command. That assumes that you built 
mod_python as a dynamic shared object.

Please send along a little more info about your problem:
1) how did you build mod_python (is it a shared object or built into apache)?
2) show the pieces of httpd.conf that are supposed to initialize the python 
module (i.e. point to the library you built).
3) what troubleshooting have you already tried (I don't know "everything in 
this list")?

I'm a refugee from PHP4 and would really like to
use something the equivalent of PHP4s sessions ?

I've spent hours going thru the mail archives and
there seems to be some reluctance (?) to accumulate
mod_python examples, or something... they're really
hard to find and essential when trying to learn python
itself, and how it fits in with mod_python, and keeping
the peace between 1.5, 2.0, 2.1 and... 

Surely there is a site out there that specializes in
mod_python scripts ? I assumed modpython.org would
have heaps of examples, but nada except the handlers
included in the package itself. Strange.

Maybe there is a lack of interest because mod_python is thought to be on a
lower level than PHP. I see mod_python as apache/python integration
software, not as a e-content system. There are no templates, no sessions,
there is no standard library. These of course can all be built on top of
mod_python, but there is (not yet) a standard content system that is
regarded as _the_ content system for mod_python. [yes, I know the publisher,
but I don't consider that to be a full blown e-content system]

Sessions, for example, would require a database to back the session data,
something that is out of scope for mod_python. Also templates would be
handy.

AFAIK there is some software (webware, cheetah, ...) out there that builds
on mod_python but I didn't like it. That's why I wrote my own e-content
system. If you seach the archives you'll find a link to a preview version of
it.

I agree with you that this distinction should be made more clear. IMHO
mod_python is _not_ an e-content system. It is not a PHP.

Sessions require much more than just a few lines of code.

I don't expect it to be either and I'm not really after
someone elses idea of what a CMS should be, but various
low(ish) level components like a generic sessions system
written by people far more experienced in python than me
would give me more confidence that something so close to
authentication is done right.

I'm after a PHP4 sessions clone, persistant store in /tmp
and fallback to transparent URL if cookies are not available.

Anyone out there know of any such beast ?

This seems like a rather simple and generic requirement to me.
Obviously if I was more competent in python I would be able
to knock something together, and also put it somewhere public
to save other PHP4 refugees from extra overload and confusion
when/if they start to consider python.

"search the archives"... hmm, wish I knew how to do that ?
Am I supposed to just keep looking thru all these messages
until I find the right one ?

Maybe you have not actually used PHP(4) but it is
certainly not a CMS either. It takes a lot of PHP code
to make a decent content management system... and to
be clear, my use of the meaning "PHP-like" simply means
not being an oh-so dumb and slow CGI. I am not looking
for a CMS (tho a "good" one would be nice) but some sane
python system that are not CGIs (that's going backwards
from using PHP, not forward).

mod_python + publisher is the closest I've been able to
find to PHP, so far, and looks potentially more powerful,
just missing a few of key components.

I don't know of any, but I didn't really look for it either. Using
transparent URL cookies would imply filtering the handler output though. I
don't think there are hooks for doing this in mod_python. This is must
easier done from the handler of a CMS.

I'm sorry, I was under the impression that a search option was available.

Is there an xmlrpc-handler for mod_python? Or would using
the SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler of the 2.2 SimpleXMLRPCServer
module be a natural thing to do? It just seems that Apache/mod_python
would be a more stable server solution than using SimpleXMLRPCServer
itself...

I think this is the same as:

     Alias /cgi-bin/ "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin/"

     <Directory "C:/apache/Apache/cgi-bin">
	 SetHandler cgi-script
         AddHandler python-program .py
         PythonHandler mptest
         PythonAuthenHandler mptest
         PythonDebug on
         AllowOverride None
         Options None
         Order allow,deny
         Allow from all
     </Directory>

Off the top of my head I don't know whether AddHandler will override
SetHandler OR whichever module is envoked first (mod_python or
mod_cgi) will handler the request. You might want to try moving around
LoadModule directives in your config to see what happens.

In any event it should either work fine or not at all - why do you say
"sort of"?

Judging by your sig I take it this is on Linux?

I haven't tested any of it on Linux. I'm doing most of mp 3.0 development
on Solaris because it's got the best thread support of all os's I have
access to.

Anyhow, this message would mean that something went wrong during
compile/link - stat is a standard C library function, it shouldn't be
missing...

Sorry, this isn't being too helpful, but then this _is_ alpha code ;-)

I don't know of such a thing offhand.  Probably the best thing to do
would be to start with the SimpleXMLRPCServer code and port the
request handler to mod_python.  It probably wouldn't be that hard to
do, but it won't be a simple plug-n-play solution, either.  It's
probably only _worth_ doing if you're going to handle some serious
load.

If you can use SOAP instead of XML RPC, you can use ZSI -- it's pretty
trivial to integrate into mod_python.  On purpose.  zsi is at

I'm sure this worked for me a few days ago (maybe
I was imaginging it and some rotuine nearby happened
to be working);

 if req._req.subprocess_env.has_key("REMOTE_ADDR"):
   rn = req._req.subprocess_env["REMOTE_ADDR"]

but now the above test is failing and when I try to
see where REMOTE_ADDR has gone I get these results...

 for k in req._req.subprocess_env.keys():
   e.write(k+"\n")

UNIQUE_ID
WE_HAVE_REWRITE
UNIQUE_ID
WE_HAVE_REWRITE
GATEWAY_INTERFACE
SERVER_PROTOCOL
REQUEST_METHOD

Is it possible that REMOTE_ADDR has been somehow
over written by the duplication of UNIQUE_ID and
WE_HAVE_REWRITE ?

I'm a python and mod_python novice so maybe my
question should be simply "how do I find REMOTE_ADDR
under mod_python" ?

I found that some http clients (Opera on windows, specifically in my

It would be hard to identify the problem without the seeing the script.

I have managed to solve the problem putting
LoadModule modules/mod_python.so 
as the last line of all the LoadModule commands and
AddModule mod_python.c
as the last line of all the AddModule commands.
This helps to kill the problem which I had previously.

Anyway, my test CGI script is very simple.

-- Start of script --
import cgi, os, sys

print 'Content-type: text/plain'
print
print os.environ()
print cgi.FieldStorage()

-- End of script --

I compiled python in /usr/local and I am using it fine from commandline and cgi, but to get this mod_python to work, I somehow need to let it know to look in /usr/local.  I figured the --with-python option would take care of that...it does find it, but I get 

'import site' failed; use -v for traceback

when compiling and in my error log when attempting to run a script.  Any thoughts?

You shouldn't need to use --with-python for this, your libpython will know
to look in /usr/local (if that's the prefix you compiled Python with,
which, BTW, is the default I think anyway)

I think your message means Apache process doesn't have persmissions to the
Python library directories.

Horray! I got the Hello World script to work.  I had to recompile python into /usr since my apache user didn't have /usr/local in the path and I wanted it in /usr anyway.  I recompiled mod_python as well and put the -DEAPI flag in the Makefile since apache kept complaining about the API config and to use this flag.  Anyway, I got it to work and I get a beautiful "hello world"

Now, what the hell do I do?  If I put another sample script (not called mptest.py but another name) in the directory where mptest.py resides, I just keep getting Hello World.  Do I have to push everything through mptest.py or what?  I am a bit confused as to how to actually do something with this mod_python.  Anyone?

Thanks for some of your suggestions. I checked security but system has full
control at modules and the specific .dll.

This is the file that is giving me headeaches:

 <<httpd.conf>> 

As in the manual I included both parts (LoadModule & <Directory>)

But when restarting Apache http server I stiil get:

"Invalid command PythonHandler, ...mispelled or module not in server
config.".

Thanks very much for any ideas (must be a simple and/or stupid mistake I
guess :)).

Apache 1.3.22 (is this causing the problem ? should I stick to 1.3.20 ???)

I had a look at your config and there is no sign of
loading up the mod_python module into apache, which
would explain the error you are seeing...

On Linux I use this in my httpd.conf...

 LoadModule python_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/mod_python.so

If that is missing then it will definately help :)

Dear Mark,

There IS actaully in this file a line (I just copied it from it...):

LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.dll

should it be in some other place or contain an absolute path (which is not
in the manual)
or should it be:

LoadModule python_module modules\mod_python.dll (backslash)

Hi Mark,

thats right, I tried all slashes: no success

I tried all configurations here (within quotes otherwise you get other
errors like this command is taking only 2 arguments which is ok). I tried
absolute path with slashes and backslashes: no success.

I put it in the right version (checked 3 times) in the standards "modules"
directory with the right permissions within the Apache folder which is
itself also in the standard place.

As you can see above I tried all perbutations I think :)

The error log stays clean.
The access log says clean.

Restart gives exactly same result as "Test Configuration functionality.

anyway, your effort is very much appreciated, Michel

the only thing I can think of is that I have to go back to an earlier
version of Apache (1.3.20 iso 1.3.22). I am going to try that first....

In the meantime, python/win expert ideas are still welcome.....

Thanks Michel

Dear All (esp. Mark, Dan and Grisha),

I swapped Apache 1.3.22 for 1.3.20 and my problem was solved. So advice:
stick with Apache 1.3.20 on windows if you want to have an integrated Python
!

Thanks for all your help, Michel

Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python 2.7.6 + Python 2.1.1 + Windows XP professonal
works fine for me, so I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong
with Apache 1.3.22 + mod_python.

FYI
I have compiled Apache 1.3.22 and mod_python with the
current Cygwin tools

This requires changing the mod_python / src / Makefile
to link with libpython2.1.dll.a instead of libpython2.1.a

Cheers

Norman

I'm also using the 2.7.4 win binary but with the 2.7.6.tgz from
http://www.modpython.org/dist/ which is the latesp mod_python python files.
Sorry if I'm confusing the issue here! The release 2.7.5.tgz notes that it
was a fix for python 2.1.

Ahhh, things getting clearer now (I though the numbers shpould
correspond....)

so I will also now try to mix 2.7.4 & 2.7.6 ... (where probabl. 2.7.5
alaready solved the problem I experienced)

thanks

You also need "AddModule mod_python.c" somewhere after ClearModuleList.

Just not to confuse people any further, your problem was with your config
file. Whenever you use ClearModuleList, you have to AddModule afterwards.

This, BTW, has nothing to do with mod_python, and is all well documented
in Apache docs.

Dear Grisha,

1
It was not my intention to confuse people any further; I was just stuck and
asked for help.

2
On your second remark on the actual problem I disagree:

2.1
"Whenever you use ClearModuleList..."

I have never explicitly used it ! Ok it can be default in some config but
you suggested I added something..

2.2
"You have to AddModule".
Please show me in the manual appendix A (win install) where this is; its
just not there.

2.3
Looking at the doc it seems that AddModule is only relevant for static
links. But of course this might be me....

my reasoning: I downloaded a binary .dll so how can I reference a source
file in the httpd.conf.

2.4
I think above is true since everything seems to work fine now after the mail
I got from Ray Drew (actually combining .ddl with higher version mod_python;
thanks Ray !)

Again, sorry if I caused any incomvenience to anybody. I just come from the
structured world of Gates and now try from a more or less end-user oriented
perspective to integrate a SW infrastructure combining Apache, xalan,
xerces, cocoon, python, and some more and then our own stuff on top. I just
want to find out which problems real end-user will face when we tell them
please do this yourself....

Greetings, Michel Bohms

Subject: [mod_python] New Handlers and other bits
Message-ID: <20011129170345.78399.qmail@0x01.com>

Dear Grischa,

I have been using mod_python for over a year now, and before that NSAPY. Many times I have developed code for mod_python that would have to be able to run as a CGI or as a script. So I wrote a bridge to handle these situations. Also I parameterized the Publisher handler and gave it transparent session handling. By breaking up this code  I acheived better control over and made the Handler easier to custimize.  Should I contribute this work to mod_python.org. If so, how?  I will galdly tidy it up and document it. Also my version of the Publisher has most of your code just lifted in, then slightly re-worked. I will be happy to have your recomendations regarding the wording of the copyright etc.

Thank you very much. You can simply e-mail it to me - we will then review
it and if all is well, add it to the future releases of mod_python.
