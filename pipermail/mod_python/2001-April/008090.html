<PRE>I think we're actually in agreement here...

My point was not that the handler is the wrong place for these types of
things, only that the handler is not a core part of the mod_python package.
Having just tackled a new handler and framework, I too would love to see
some more visible framework solutions for mod_python.  That being said, one
of the best things about mod_python is that it isn't really a web app
framework.  It's a barebones implementation that requires some sort of
framework (a handler or more) for an actual app to be developed.

Similarly, I don't think a session handler is 'bad', just that making it a
part of the mod_python package weighs down the implementation (for those
that don't want/use it).  One of the reasons open source development works
so well is that the software is _highly_ componentized, thereby allowing
grisha to focus on his part and whoever to focus on something like a session
handler on top of mod_python (but not as a part of it).

I think we all see value in having the functionality available, and it
appears there's just a disagreement on how it should be made available (in
relation to mod_python).

Just my thoughts.  Take 'em or leave 'em.

I have to disagree.  I think that mod-python (and mod_snake) handlers are
perfect places to put session handlers.  To me, the mod_python framework is
somewhat equivelent to the PHP module only more flexable.  PHP implemented
sessions, and there is no reason why mod_python should be innapropriate for
the
task.  It may be a bit difficult, but not impossible.  If Apache 2.0 has
some
sort of shared memory, then obviously, this is a potential place.  Other
places
certainly include cookies and databases.  The clear advantage of the shared
memory scenario is speed.  This is definitely the case for a
session.data_base_connection variable.  You would have to access the data
base
way to many times just to do a simple query.  I hate having to recreate
database connections every page, and I don't like leaving one open all the
time.  I would much prefer to open it once for each user, then close it when
things time out.

I guess I don't understand why a session handler would be so bad.  If the
goal
of mod_python is to give access, through a python interface, to the
internals
of apache in order to create pages or other environments, why can't we just
treat sessions as a feature, or object that we create in a handler?

I'm not suggesting that mod_python should come packaged with session
capabilities built in.  NO WAY!  What I am saying is that a session handler,
that somebody develops and posts on the mod_python page, could be available
and
tremendously usefull.  I know that mod_snake comes packaged with 3 or 4
&quot;typical&quot; handlers that you can choose to use, or not.  One is a python-cgi
accelerator, one is an embedded python handler; why would a session handler
not
be appropriate?  Then, the users could have a base session handler that they
could modify as they see fit.  If they want a more specific thing, specify.
If
you want a more general thing, either remove some code, or at worst, you
have
an example to work with.

Just my opinions.

</I>&gt;<i> In my (humble) opinion, things like this are outside the scope of
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python, since the goal of mod_python is apache/python integration -
</I>&gt;<i> not building web application frameworks. In other words, mod_python is
</I>&gt;<i> something that makes Apache internals available in Python to give the
</I>&gt;<i> developer more power and speed, it's not something to make web application
</I>&gt;<i> development necessarily easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few of application frameworks out there that support
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python - webware is one of them. I don't know much about those things,
</I>&gt;<i> but I think they have features like state keeping, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (To that extent, even the mod_python.publisher handler is outside the
</I>&gt;<i> scope of mod_python, but I am willing to pursue it since it is immediately
</I>&gt;<i> usable, it serves as good test for advanced mod_python capabilities and
</I>&gt;<i> it's a pretty a good mod_python example program.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, there should be an area on the website that lists mod_python
</I>&gt;<i> modules that do various things that aren't part of mod_python
</I>&gt;<i> distribution. Right now there aren't enough of them out there to justify
</I>&gt;<i> it, but eventually there will be I'm sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you develop something that serves a particular need, please post it
</I>&gt;<i> to the list, and eventually we will have a collection of mod_python
</I>&gt;<i> modules/examples/whatever that people can use.
