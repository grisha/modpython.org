The last thing I want to do is discourage use of mod_python to new members 
of the list.  I'm very thankful for the solution you've created in 
mod_python and I want to see it grow.  I'm in the process of porting a 
couple moderately high traffic sites over to mod_python now.

Yes, I have been using the beta (primarily because I wanted to use PSP), 
and I realize it could just be a problem with the beta.  However, after my 
original post on threading, I got no response save for Perry's who seemed 
to be having difficulty with threading as well.  I don't mean to be 
spreading dis-information, it's just that no one had taken the time to 
correct my dis-information until now.


&gt;<i>Second - I think you gave up on that particular problem and drew a
</I>&gt;<i>conclusion way to eraly. Posting the problem code to the list would be a
</I>&gt;<i>start :-)
</I>
In my post I described an output filter that was sending part of one 
request and part of another unrelated request in the first request.  In 
other words, requests were getting mixed up mid-stream.  Is this even 
something that can be done in python purposely without resorting to global 
or module level namespaces?  The filter I was using was pretty simple.  It 
just did some update queries based on information from the filter.req 
object and then called filter.pass_on().  I'll try and reproduce the 
problem without the database queries, just a filter.pass_on() call and then 
I'll let you know what I get.
