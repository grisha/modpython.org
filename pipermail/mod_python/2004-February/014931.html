Grisha,

I posted a problem I ran into a couple weeks ago to this list (subject: 
3.1.2b and worker_mpm).  Seems the output filter under load was mixing up 
requests.  When making a request I would get part of my request plus part 
of another request.  When I changed to a prefork model, that problem went 
away.  The only response I got to my message was from Perry who claims &quot;it 
went to pieces under stress testing&quot; and &quot;I saw some
wicked nasty recursion errors&quot; in reference to the worker_mpm and 
mod_python.  Since I didn't get any response from you or anyone else in the 
know about these things, I was left to assume that this was a weak area for 
mod_python which would receive attention in due time.  I even offered my 
assistance for testing.  I don't know how else to describe the problem I 
experienced except for a threading issue.

Perhaps there's something there that you're not aware of.  I, for one, 
would love to be able to use worker_mpm again.

-Dan
