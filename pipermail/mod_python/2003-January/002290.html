<PRE>Thanks for that,

I have managed to sort out the problem now; it is to do with the Path
Environment Variable that Apache was running under, which has python (1.5)
as the first python executable on it, so this was causing the version
mismatch.  The only thing I am unsure about is where Apache is
getting/setting this environment variable as for all users the python
version that is on their path is version 2.2.1 (the one I want to use).  As
a work around I have linked python 2.2.1 to /bin/python and it now seems to
work without any problems.

Thanks again
Tim.

My guess is that you have multiple versions of python installed, and apache
is
picking up a different python version based on a different PATH environment
or some such.
