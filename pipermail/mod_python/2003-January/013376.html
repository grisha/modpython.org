<PRE>Thanks Baz,

Just to clarify this a bit as I am quite new to all this, I can output my
Initial Page, including some Java Script and then later on output some more
Java Script which will then update the page on the Client.

I don't suppose you know of somewhere where I can see an example of this, as
that would be really useful.

Thanks
Tim.

You can achieve this by sending pieces of javacript whenever you want to
update something (like a progress bar or whatever).

You also need to be able to flush the output buffer to apache, (my setup
seems to do this implicitly ?) otherwise i would've tried req.flush().

Works on major browsers, just make sure you send &lt;script&gt; tags everytime
for this is needed by NN4 (or later?).
