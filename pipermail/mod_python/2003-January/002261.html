<PRE>Hi,

I have recently installed Python 2.2.2 and Apache 2.0.43, and have
configured a directory to execute mod_python.  The problem I have is I
do not seem to be able to access any of the environment variables in the
Request Object form object.  Below is the part of my httpd.conf file and
also the python script that I am using.

# Adding directory for python
Alias /python/ &quot;/usr/local/apache2/mod_python/&quot;

&lt;Directory &quot;/usr/local/apache2/mod_python&quot;&gt;
    AddHandler python-program .py
    SetHandler python-program
    PythonPath &quot;sys.path+['/usr/local/apache2/mod_python']&quot;
    PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
    Options +ExecCGI
    PythonDebug On
&lt;/Directory&gt;

And the python function is as follows:

def my_test(req):
  dict = req.form

  list = req.form.list

  keys = dict.keys()
  str = dict_to_str(dict)

  str = &quot;&lt;H1&gt;Test Page for FieldStorage&lt;/H1&gt;\n&quot;+ str + &quot;\nlen(list) %d&quot;
% len(list)

  return str


If anyone had any ideas or somewhere I can look at some examples for
using CGI Environment variables that would be really helpful.

Thanks in advance
regards
Tim.
