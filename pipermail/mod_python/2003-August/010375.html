About the technical issue, CGI was never asked about, mod_python is
normally used INSTEAD of cgi. 

The question was really how to run a python handler for every possible
URL, not to include cgi-output withing HTML.

(in which case I would have solved it anyway by using the mod_python
solution presented in this thread)


A quick note about the SetHandler trick (I use it to get virtual URLs -
what I would like to see is some functionallity from Publisher (argument
parsing, return content-type-magic) - used together with virtual URLs.
Ie allowing /browse/some-switch.domain.com/switchports without actually
having the object &quot;some-switch.domain.com&quot; - the quick solution probably
being some __getattr__-magic) 


Remember that even though you SetHandler to something, 
you'll also need to set DirectoryIndex to some EXISTING FILE. I did this
error as I included all python code in the pythonpath and had no files
in the actual path. I used SetHandler nav.web.devBrowser.dispatcher
in .htaccess for a blank directory.

Now, DirectoryIndex could not simply be index.html, as there were no
file index.html. I created a file &quot;index&quot; in the otherwise blank
directory, set DirectoryIndex to &quot;index&quot;, and everything worked.

If the file is removed, the blank directory listing is presented, but
other urls within the directory works.

(the handler receives the request as being to /index, and the file is
never actually read from disk due to SetHandler intercepting)

Now, some gurus might have a suggestion about getting rid of that empty
file. If so, please let me know! =)


Why not have the files inside the directory? Well, we've encountered
*some* problems with developers each making &quot;index.py&quot; (they 
previously programmed PHP!) - within the same namespace (ie.
Subinterpreter). This caused problems like getting some modules from
each of the users public_html directory. Funny!

We've used PythonInterpPerDirectory while developing, but needs to get
rid of that before merging code, as this eats database connections as a
horse. (remember, one connection pr database pr. interpreter pr.
apache.. scales up!)
