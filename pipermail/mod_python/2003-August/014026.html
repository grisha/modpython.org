It might be blurry when a directory handler is used, but it's not at all
blurry in
this case, where mod_python is acting as a handler for requests for
.py files. SCRIPT_NAME should simply point to the .py file that has
been requested.

</I>
The CGI specification may define SCRIPT_NAME in terms of processes and
script files, but the SCRIPT_NAME is not just used for CGI. It's used in PHP
and ASP and other web interfaces, and is also useful in mod_python when
mod_python doesn't mangle it.

</I>
But, AFAICT, it is tinkering with the value. Under the apache CGI
environment, the SCRIPT_NAME value is just the portion of the URL pointing
at the script being handled, but in mod_python when the request ends in a
slash, the value has extra stuff appended. So mod_python must be doing
something that mod_cgi is not.

&gt;<i> P.S. If you look at build_cgi_env() in apache.py, it seems to adress
</I>&gt;<i> this issue.
</I>
That code does sort of address this issue, but in an indirect way. Instead
of using the mangled SCRIPT_NAME value in subprocess_env, it recomputes it
using req.uri and req.path_info. This is similar to the workaround I used in
my last posting, and it also will fail in the presence of double slashes in
PATH_INFO. It would be better to fix this bug instead of using these
unreliable workarounds.
