<PRE>So, the time has come. I need to start a new project and also migrate my 
old mod_python stuff to something else :(

After all the sweat, blood and tears I put into learning about how 
Python web apps work, learning how to use mod_python, and how to put web 
apps together (using mod_python). It's really sad to think that a good 
portion of that effort seems lost because, unfortunately, mod_python is 
deprecated :(

I looked at a few web frameworks but found they either simply didn't 
work, exhibited weird random unpredictable behaviour that was impossible 
to work with, or seemed to abstract so far away from real HTTP which 
made me feel uncomfortable. I finally settled on mod_python because it 
seemed to be a nice balance of powerful functionality and usefulness - 
oh, and it worked.

With mod_python I felt as though I was working closely with the HTTP 
requests because I could use the request objects directly and, if I 
wanted (and I did), stick stuff in them to use in sessions. mod_python 
seemed pretty raw, but not so much so that I had to write my own request 
handlers and all the nitty gritty things like that (which, being new to 
web development, was and probably still is beyond my ability to do well 
and securely). I liked it because it also provided lots of in-built 
utilities making it really easy to do session handling, redirection and 
so on.

I'm trying to avoid using one of the mainstream frameworks because I 
feel they overcomplicate things, bloat things up, and abstract too much 
away from what is really going on. Many of them annoyingly also end up 
requiring a bazillion dependencies to install. Personally I like to use 
small and compact programs that are really good at doing the small 
number of things I need them to, as opposed to installing some giant 
application (and all its dependencies) that can do everything under the 
sun I'll never use.

With all this in mind. I was hoping someone would please be so kind as 
to recommend things that I could use instead of mod_python as a WSGI 
layer, but that hopefully works in a similar way to mod_python?

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
mog
