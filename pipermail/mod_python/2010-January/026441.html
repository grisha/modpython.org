Sorry guys, I think it would have helped for me to be a bit more specific.

I am definitely going to be using mod_wsgi as the the Python/Apache 
interpreter; in fact, I installed and tested mod_wsgi last night on my 
server - it seems to work just fine.

What I wasn't sure about were the ways in which mod_wsgi is different to 
mod_python. For example, my app would make use of mod_python's session 
support and put a user_id into the request object so it was persistent 
(accessing the request info directly). It would also use internal 
redirects for pages that required authentication; so if a user needed to 
log in first, it would automatically show them a login screen and then 
take them to their requested page following a successful login.

I was under the impression that mod_wsgi did not provide similar 
functionality for these common things for me to use (like mod_python 
does). So I'd need to use some kind of utilities or &quot;framework&quot; to help 
me with this. I guess what I was really asking for advice on was: what I 
might be able to use to help me effectively migrate from mod_python to 
mod_wsgi... It seems as though Werkzeug might be promising.

Thanks to everyone who replied and offered advice/suggestions, it is 
greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
mog
