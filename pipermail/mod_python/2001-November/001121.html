I implemented a very simple session module which mostly works --- it
worked well enough for the task I had at the time. It generates an
opaque session identifier which corresponds to the name of a file on
disk containing pickled session data.

As I look at it now, it isn't robust in the face of multiple clients
sharing the session id, but as I said it was written in about twenty
minutes for an internal app.

&gt;<i> 	Oh, and if anyone has some experience with existing session modules I would 
</I>&gt;<i> be open to suggestion (I have seen a few around). I would prefer that it be 
</I>&gt;<i> stable and somewhat scalable (I was thinking caching to a flat file 
</I>&gt;<i> sequentially might not work well under all circumstances), but I don't know 
</I>&gt;<i> whether that is necessary anyway.
</I>
Are there any decent ones? I remember doing a brief search and not
finding anything I immediately liked.

I'd certainly be interested in tossing my code over the fence as the
seed for a more robust session manager.
