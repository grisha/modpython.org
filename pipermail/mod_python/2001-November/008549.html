I don't expect it to be either and I'm not really after
someone elses idea of what a CMS should be, but various
low(ish) level components like a generic sessions system
written by people far more experienced in python than me
would give me more confidence that something so close to
authentication is done right.

I'm after a PHP4 sessions clone, persistant store in /tmp
and fallback to transparent URL if cookies are not available.

Anyone out there know of any such beast ?

This seems like a rather simple and generic requirement to me.
Obviously if I was more competent in python I would be able
to knock something together, and also put it somewhere public
to save other PHP4 refugees from extra overload and confusion
when/if they start to consider python.

</I>
&quot;search the archives&quot;... hmm, wish I knew how to do that ?
Am I supposed to just keep looking thru all these messages
until I find the right one ?

&gt;<i>&#160;I agree with you that this distinction should be made more clear. IMHO
</I>&gt;<i>&#160;mod_python is _not_ an e-content system. It is not a PHP.
</I>
Maybe you have not actually used PHP(4) but it is
certainly not a CMS either. It takes a lot of PHP code
to make a decent content management system... and to
be clear, my use of the meaning &quot;PHP-like&quot; simply means
not being an oh-so dumb and slow CGI. I am not looking
for a CMS (tho a &quot;good&quot; one would be nice) but some sane
python system that are not CGIs (that's going backwards
from using PHP, not forward).

mod_python + publisher is the closest I've been able to
find to PHP, so far, and looks potentially more powerful,
just missing a few of key components.
