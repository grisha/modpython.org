<PRE>Troy,

Thanks for the PyCon report, and the mod_python flag waving while you 
were there. :)

</I>&gt;<i> I attended (in fact, I almost killed Scott (the originator of this
</I>&gt;<i> thread) driving to a book party).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was surprised that there were no sessions specifically about
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python, so I added a BoF meeting (posted the announcement to this
</I>&gt;<i> group).  About 10 people showed up and we talked mostly about how to
</I>&gt;<i> successfully deploy mod_python.  Of the group, only a couple of people
</I>&gt;<i> were actually using mod_python, the rest were seeking additional
</I>&gt;<i> information.  Kevin Lewandowski reported his www.discogs.com site at 2
</I>&gt;<i> million page views (a month I think?) running mod_python on 4
</I>&gt;<i> load-balanced servers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The django guys were at the conference (but not the BoF), presented a
</I>&gt;<i> couple topics/sessions, and recommended mod_python for deployment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> American Greeting also presented a session, I'll have to check my
</I>&gt;<i> notes, but they run a lot of traffic through their online greeting
</I>&gt;<i> services.  However, I asked during the Q &amp; A about their use of
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python, and they do not use it on their main web sites.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Being new to Python and mod_python and my first PyCon, I can say that
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python seems to be known by those doing web-development with
</I>&gt;<i> Python.  However, there does not seem to be any references to it being
</I>&gt;<i> used for heavy lifting.  I recently had a chat with the co-creator of
</I>&gt;<i> feedlounge.com (a pure Python Ajax application) about their
</I>&gt;<i> experiences with mod_python (they currently are not using it, do to
</I>&gt;<i> ref issues with SQLObject) and he mentioned taking another look at it
</I>&gt;<i> appears updates are coming faster.  Some people at the BoF were not
</I>&gt;<i> aware that mod_python development is as active as it is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For what it is worth, I have recently chosen mod_python for the next
</I>&gt;<i> generation of my company's product (a high traffic, b2b web
</I>&gt;<i> application).  When complete, I hope it will be a great reference site
</I>&gt;<i> for others evaluating mod_python.  Early tests show mod_python easliy
</I>&gt;<i> handling 500 reqs/sec with the worker and event MPM's serving 100%
</I>&gt;<i> db-backed dynamic content on modest hardware.  We created and benched
</I>&gt;<i> the same part of our application in PHP and got 200 reqs/sec, 300 with
</I>&gt;<i> opcode caching.  Performance isn't even our primary decision point,
</I>&gt;<i> but it is nice to know mod_python has it nailed.
</I>&gt;<i>
