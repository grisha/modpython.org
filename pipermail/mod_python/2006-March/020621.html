<PRE>A decision for a DBMS should not be based on little syntactic 
differences. In the end, no DB is compatible with any other, and the 
overvalued holy grail of database engine independence is never found. 
And though I've seen many projects with that grail high in their 
requirements and design, I have never ever seen one actually switch DBMS 
- projects tend to stick to the choice. In the end, technical 
differences aren't that big.

A decision for a DBMS should be based on specific features, tools and 
support. I have used many DBMS systems, including Informix, Oracle, 
SQLServer, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. They all have their strengths 
and weaknesses.

The reason I mention MySQL is not that it's my personal favorite, but 
because it is a mature engine, cheap, well supported, and will give 
little problems during startup. It is also very transparent, which is a 
big plus for starting with &quot;home&quot; development.

In the end, it really won't make a big difference which one you choose. 
Pick the one that seems readily available. If you're inexperienced with 
managing a database, pick the one your neighbour is using so that he may 
help you in getting things running easily.

Any &quot;Which DB&quot; post in any newsgroup tends to result in long lasting 
discussions, which is indication enough that all the products are at 
comparable levels.
