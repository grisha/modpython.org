Speaking as both a web developer and a programmer, I wouldn't find this 
restriction particularly interesting in a bakeoff. I'm rarely happy with 
the designs I'm handed, but I'm always interested in learning new 
techniques. An unrestricted approach provides an opportunity to learn 
from others, even if they don't emerge as the overall &quot;winner&quot;.

There's no question that a poorly programmed webapp that looks fantastic 
on the surface might steal thunder from another with a superior code 
base, so it's obvious that the entries would need to be judged by 
multiple criteria. A battery of tests needs to be devised to test 
performance and scalability.
