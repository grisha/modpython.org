<PRE>Anyone who reads my followups to questions asked here would
know I tend to recommend that one avoid the use of the MultiViews
option. This is especially the case if you are using SetHandler to
create a handler which handles all requests in a directory.

All the same, use of MultiViews is still popular with people using
AddHandler and mod_python.publisher so they can avoid having to use
&quot;.py&quot; in the URL. The best configuration that one can use is:

  AddHandler mod_python .py
  PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
  PythonDebug On

  Options +MultiViews
  MultiviewsMatch Handlers

This would then allow one to use:

  /some/path/page

instead of:

  /some/path/page.py

This though still has problems where you have non &quot;.py&quot; files in the
same directory which share the same basename as a &quot;.py&quot; file but a
different extension.

For example, if you have a file &quot;page.psp&quot; in the same directory, all
still works okay for the above URL.

If however you add a file &quot;page.html&quot; or &quot;page.txt&quot; into the directory,
preference is given first to the &quot;.html&quot; file, next the &quot;.txt&quot;.

In other words, the a handler for a specific extension has a lower
precedence than a physical &quot;.html&quot; or &quot;.txt&quot; file, yet the handler gets
precedence over a file type with an extension.

Why this occurs is all tied up with the weighting preference for different
file types as specified by the browser. For example:

  Accept: text/html; q=1.0, text/*; q=0.8

Plus I assume some parts of the Apache configuration itself.

The problem with this is that if the &quot;.html&quot; file is actually mean't to be
an input to some processing done by the handler, a request is going to
pick up the raw unprocessed &quot;.html&quot; file instead of running it through
the handler.

Such are some of the issues with using MultiViews. The simple fix is
to not use MultiViews and use &quot;.py&quot; extensions in the URLs, which is
what I suggest, and all the problems go away.

I would rather like to understand how one could configure Apache to
redefine the precedence order to always ensure the handler gets
precedence. Does this make sense? Is it possible?

Note, I don't actually use mod_python.publisher myself. I am purely
trying to understand this better so I might perhaps be able to give out
better answers to people when they ask about these issues.
