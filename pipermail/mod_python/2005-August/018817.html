<PRE>I have been trying unsuccessfully to get mod_python happening and wonder 
if it is even possible given the scope / constraints in my system.

In a nutshell I cannot get Apache to load mod_python without segfaults. 
(see error_log excerpt below)

If there is a kind person who could look at this and let me know whether 
it is worthwhile pushing on I would appreciate it. These are the bits 
and pieces already installed and what I want to do ...

1.   SuSE 9.1 Linux on a Pentium 3 with 256Mb RAM and ample disk space.
2.   Apache 2.0.53-5.1 (prefork) (i586)
3.   Apache mod_python 3.1.3-37.6
4.   Apache subversion-server 1.1.3-7.1 (some bdb and some fsfs)
5.   Firebird SS 1.5.2.4731 (i686) (NPTL version)
6.   Python interpreter 2.3.3-88.9
7.   Subversion-python 1.1.3-7.1 (not using this)
8.   Samba-python 3.0.9-2.6 (dunno why - but it is installed)

Subversion is working and Apache serves its standard hello world page. 
The box is on a LAN behind NAT and accessed also externally for 
Subversion purposes. I just changed Firebird to the NPTL version so I 
wouldn't have to use KD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 environment variable which 
was interfering with Berkeley DB being used by Subversion. Out of that 
mess I changed two repositories from Berkeley to FSFS (plain text file 
database) I have not yet change the other repositories. Everything is 
very lightly loaded. I am the heaviest user and there are only two 
others at the moment.

What I want to do is use Firebird as a backend database for some Python 
web development. At the moment I'm forced to do the dev on a Windows box 
but I want it served by the above Linux box.

Any ideas?

Thanks

Mike
