In what way are you using mod_python.publisher? Depending to what
degree you are using it, mod_python 3.3 offers some alternate mechanisms
for doing basic dispatch against different resources which might be more
useful and allow you to still access content of response to decode it.

&gt;<i> &gt; In a normal HTML form, the data would be sent as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application/x-www-form-urlencoded, in the XForms world however, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information is sent as XML formatted data (application/xml).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Up to now I've used cherryPy as web server and I've got my xml data with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cherrypy.threadData.xform.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've read that PHP receive this in $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA variable. If I
</I>&gt;<i> send
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the form to a php script all work fine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But when I try to submit a xforms with method POST to a script managed
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; publisher handler I get an error with no log in my apache server error
</I>&gt;<i> log.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any help?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You'll need to elaborate on the error you are getting, but I think part
</I>&gt;<i> of the problem is that you are bumping up against part of the internal
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;magic&quot; of publisher.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Publisher automatically creates a FieldStorage instance. Unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> FieldStorage assumes that the content-type starts with either 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; or &quot;multipart/&quot;. If I had to guess
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say that you are getting &quot;501 Not Implemented error&quot; as a result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here are a couple of solutions that you might consider as a workaround:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Hack util.FieldStorage to properly handle your content-type. If you
</I>&gt;<i> do this feel free to submit a patch so FieldStorage can be fixed. ;)
</I>
Hmmm, xforms is quite different.

  <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/</A>

Looks like a lot of work.

&gt;<i> 2. Hack publisher to skip the automatic creation of FieldStorage. (Line
</I>&gt;<i> 424 in publisher.py for mod_python 3.3.0b). You can then use req.read()
</I>&gt;<i> to read and process the POST'd data within your content handler.
</I>
I've raised this issue before about publisher not being able to accept other
content types. See:

  <A HREF="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-29">http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-29</A>

Also, like PSP now does, publisher could be made to use 'req.form' if it
already existed. This would allow a stacked response handler before
publisher to decide whether some other form content was supplied, decode
it and set req.form to a compatible class to FieldStorage. I don't know that I
have created an issue for that idea before, but have certainly thought
about it and perhaps mentioned it on the mailing list.

&gt;<i> 3. Use a PythonFixupHandler before the content handler. In the 
</I>&gt;<i> fixuphandler use req.read() to grab the raw data and adjust the 
</I>&gt;<i> content-type header so that FieldStorage doesn't bomb out. Note that if
</I>&gt;<i> you want to pass xml field data as parameters to your handler method 
</I>&gt;<i> you'll need to do a bit more work. For example
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> def index(foo=&quot;bar&quot;):
</I>&gt;<i>      return &quot;whatever&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> won't get foo from your xml data. You can likely work around this but 
</I>&gt;<i> you'll need to take a look at the source for FieldStorage and publisher
</I>&gt;<i> to work out a strategy.
</I>
If you are talking about modifying the input stream, an input filter would
perhaps be better. Not sure that that will help since xforms is quite
different and isn't just a matter of changing content type.
