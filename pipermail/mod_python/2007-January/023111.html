<PRE>In addition to Graham's (as usual much more useful and less cryptic) 
response, I think you can detect the request for a '100-continue' 
because the browser sends out a &quot;Expect: continue&quot; or something like 
that (don't have the exact information here, but RFC2068 will help you 
out).

The only way to stop the client from sending you data once the 
100-continue has been sent is to close the underlying socket connection. 
It is good practice to send a &quot;Connection: Close&quot; header along with your 
error response. The underlying socket is available as req.connection if 
i'm not mistaken. This is not very &quot;nice&quot; to the client, and should be 
used only if you expect really big downloads. You might want to check 
the Content-Length of the upload - if it is less than say 16k, it is 
probably more efficient to just &quot;eat&quot; the data even though you're not 
going to process it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Yes. Write out an error and close the HTTP connection.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, whether you can stop the client sending any of the actual data
</I>&gt;<i> contained in the body of the POST request depends on a few issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First off, if the client is using the HTTP 1.0 protocol the answer is that you
</I>&gt;<i> cannot. This is because with HTTP 1.0 protocol the client will immediately
</I>&gt;<i> start sending the body of the POST. Thus even if the server side returns an
</I>&gt;<i> error status based on looking at only the URL for the request, the client will
</I>&gt;<i> already have potentially sent all the actual data. The return of the error from
</I>&gt;<i> a handler on the server should result in the connection being dropped and so
</I>&gt;<i> the server will not read the data, but this will not have prevented some amount
</I>&gt;<i> of bandwidth being used up by the client to send the data anyway. How much data
</I>&gt;<i> the client will have sent will depend on how much will get buffered by the
</I>&gt;<i> connection before it would have detected the connection had closed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the client is using the HTTP/1.1 protocol it gets more interesting. This is
</I>&gt;<i> because HTTP/1.1 implements a mechanism whereby a client can request that the
</I>&gt;<i> server send a 100 continue status response before it will actually start
</I>&gt;<i> sending the body of the POST request. This is something that is dealt with at a
</I>&gt;<i> lower layer than mod_python so you don't have to worry about it yourself. How
</I>&gt;<i> it works with mod_python though, is that the very first time that the handler
</I>&gt;<i> calls req.read(), the lower level layers will take that as meaning you are
</I>&gt;<i> ready to start consuming the data and so Apache will send back a 100 continue
</I>&gt;<i> response to the client and it will only then start sending the data. If rather
</I>&gt;<i> than call req.read(), the handler returns an error response instead, then the
</I>&gt;<i> client will see the error response and will stop before it has even sent the
</I>&gt;<i> body of the POST request.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, although with both HTTP 1.0 and 1.1, the way to end the request early is to
</I>&gt;<i> send the error response, only with HTTP 1.1 protocol may you be able to get the
</I>&gt;<i> client to stop before it has actually sent any data at all. This though can
</I>&gt;<i> only be achieved if you can determine whether the request should be aborted
</I>&gt;<i> from just the URL and the request headers. If the only way you can work out if
</I>&gt;<i> the request is to be aborted is from the actual body of the POST request, then
</I>&gt;<i> none of this applies and the client is always going to send some amount of
</I>&gt;<i> the data anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>2.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Is there a good/recommended way how to find out the file extension?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I use a handler that can find the extension( using  util.FieldStorage(req))
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>but it does not stop uploading in progress but uploads the whole file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>first.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Create a FieldStorage instance, and pass it the callbacks for file 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>processing. You'll be called while the file stream is being read, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you can check the extension at that time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As pointed out above though, if the extension is being derived from the
</I>&gt;<i> filename attribute of the Content-Disposition header within a part of the
</I>&gt;<i> multipart/mixed body of the POST request, this means that req.read() would have
</I>&gt;<i> had to have been called and so none of the above applies and the client has had
</I>&gt;<i> to send some of the data anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All you can achieve by using the file callbacks is to detect that the extension
</I>&gt;<i> is unacceptable before the client has sent too much data by sending back
</I>&gt;<i> the error response. You can't stop all of it being sent and how much will still
</I>&gt;<i> be sent will depend a bit of buffering within the network, by Apache and how
</I>&gt;<i> big a chunks of data FieldStorage consumes in one go.
