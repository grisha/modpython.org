<PRE>Hi,

 &gt;req.sendfile('c:/apache/htdocs/myfile.xml')
In my real case, the response contain &quot;dynamic&quot; data built with database 
extracted rows.
So it's may be not the best thing to do (storing it first in a file).

 &gt;       SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
Now, it works finally! even without this directive.

In fact the right question would be:
&quot;what is the difference between req.write(bla) and return bla ?&quot;

Firefox browser is certainly http-tolerant and can manage some 
&quot;imperfect&quot; http dialogs.
Of course, the problem I meet could be caused by bad implementation in 
MyHttpClient side.
But the same comp in the sames conditions fails when response is 
&quot;written&quot; and works fine when the response is &quot;returned&quot;, bizare non ?
I would like to well understand the origin of this difference of 
behaviour, to avoid to meet it again in prod stage.
So I will &quot;dive&quot; deeply in apache documentation ...

special thanks for Graham Dumpleton and all his rich comments ...

 &gt;&gt; hi,
 &gt;&gt; what is the difference between serving a file directly or by calling a
 &gt;&gt; script function?
 &gt;&gt; case 1: <A HREF="http://localhost/myfile.xml">http://localhost/myfile.xml</A>
 &gt;&gt; case 2: <A HREF="http://localhost/mydir/boo/getfile">http://localhost/mydir/boo/getfile</A>
 &gt;&gt; Must I do special call to apache api when compression is activated?
 &gt;&gt; With Firefox, every thing works fine in two cases.
 &gt;&gt; With a http client component I'm using in my developpements, both case
 &gt;&gt; 1
 &gt;&gt; and case 2 works fine if I don't ask for compressed data. If I do
 &gt;&gt; (Accept-Encoding: gzip), case 1 works fine but case 2 fails.
 &gt;
 &gt; Your Apache configuration only enables the DEFLATE output filter for 
static
 &gt; files in your htdocs directory, it doesn't enable it for anything 
under mydir
 &gt; so unless DEFLATE is being enable somehow elsewhere in the Apache 
configuration
 &gt; the output of your published functions would never be compressed.
 &gt;
 &gt; See other notes further done mixed in with your code and configuration.
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; I noticed that returning apache.OK adds unexpected extra &quot;0&quot; on the 
output.
 &gt;
 &gt; Which would be what one expects as functions published using
 &gt; mod_python.publisher are not the same as basic mod_python handlers. 
When using
 &gt; mod_python.publisher the result of the published function is 
converted to a
 &gt; string and written back as response content. In a basic mod_python 
handler the
 &gt; response is a status indicating success of otherwise of the handler. 
Look at
 &gt; the documentation again to see the difference.
 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; thanks.
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; DocumentRoot &quot;C:/Apache/htdocs&quot;
 &gt;&gt; &lt;Directory /&gt;
 &gt;&gt;     Options FollowSymLinks
 &gt;&gt;     AllowOverride None
 &gt;&gt;     Order deny,allow
 &gt;&gt;     Deny from all
 &gt;&gt;     Satisfy all
 &gt;&gt;     SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
 &gt;&gt; &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &gt;&gt;
 &gt;&gt; Alias /mydir &quot;C:/MYDIR&quot;
 &gt;&gt; &lt;Directory C:/MYDIR&gt;
 &gt;&gt;     Allow from All
 &gt;&gt;     SetHandler mod_python
 &gt;&gt;     PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
 &gt;
 &gt; Because this is a separate physical directory with distinct Directory
 &gt; directive, you would also need here:
 &gt;
 &gt;       SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
 &gt;
 &gt; to have response from published functions be compressed.
 &gt;
 &gt; Do take heed of the Apache documentation I pointed you to originally in
 &gt; regard to DEFLATE module and a possible need to ensure you don't enable
 &gt; it for some clients because of broken compressed data implementations
 &gt; in those clients. Also, you shouldn't enable DEFLATE for all file 
types as files
 &gt; such as images are usually already compressed and compressing them
 &gt; again is a pointless exercise.
 &gt;
 &gt; Another alternative with mod_python 3.3 is to actually make the judgement
 &gt; within the published function as to whether for a specific response 
the output
 &gt; should be compressed or not. To do this, before writing back any content
 &gt; from the function, call:
 &gt;
 &gt;     req.add_output_filter('DEFLATE')
 &gt;
 &gt; This is the same as having using 'SetOutputFilter' in the Apache 
configuration.
 &gt;
