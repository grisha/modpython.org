</I>

Maybe I did not explain things very well?  I am using mod_python.publisher,
which does its magic calling my functions automagically.  In my called
functions, I simply return a string.


Why did you hardcode a hostname in the first place? It's easy to write a
&gt;<i> publisher application that is portable between hosts. You may be better
</I>&gt;<i> off ripping the hostname out and making sure that your relative links
</I>&gt;<i> are properly constructed. Or, you could pass the hostname as an argument.
</I>

I hardcoded them because I sort of hacked this together about 4 or so years
ago --  you learn a lot in four years. Would I hardcode the server name
today - well no:).  (But this is not relevant to my question, imo).

As I mentioned, the typical approach with Publisher is to have a
&gt;<i> function return a string (the web page) to the browser. You can
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate this string in the return statement to modify it, if you
</I>&gt;<i> wish. If you want a 'quick fix' that involves tampering with mod_python
</I>&gt;<i> or Apache internals, you are probably better off correcting the design
</I>&gt;<i> flaws in your application instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I'm quite aware of how the publisher works.  But the problem is, I have
this string scattered through a handful of modules.  Yeah, I'll fix them
correctly in the future.  For now I need a bandaid.  I have that bandaid, a
modified  copy of mod_python's publisher.py.

Yeah, it'd be better to fix the website, but I'm in a time crunch.  Plus,
publisher.py is well written / commented.  So plugging in my fix well was
simple - about 4 lines IIRC.  (Nice job mod_python developers!)

In the end, I guess there is no way to intercept the `req.write' call before
the publisher makes it.

Thanks,
