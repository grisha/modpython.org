<PRE>hello,

I'm among those...

I fully agree.

&gt;<i>There a couple of questions that I have about it though -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. First - is there really a great need for embedded Python? Are a lot of

</I>
I'm not using PMZ, but I tried moderately to make it work with
mod_python. I have to say that this Handler process is still cryptic to
me.

&gt;<i> 2. Would this be something that is more desired than other fancy things
</I>&gt;<i> like dynamic handler registration and a deeper integration with apache
</I>&gt;<i> api? In other words, would you rather have a cool embedded Python thing
</I>&gt;<i> than the ability to create your own Apache configuration directives?
</I>
Is that so difficult to implement? Isn't this PMZ already usable for
this purpose? (of course, with a good knowledge of mod_python)

&gt;<i> 3. Should embedded Python be a project of its own, or would it be
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate to include it in the scope of mod_python?
</I>
Why another project? As a dedicated python handler for mod_python, that
sounds fine to me. (that can be only one example of mod_python use,
really good indeed)

Thank you for the good work already put in mod_python,

Best regards,

-Sylvan
