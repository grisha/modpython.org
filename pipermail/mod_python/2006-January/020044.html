<PRE>Hello,

I'm working on a web-based gui for some application in mod_python, using 
publisher as a request handler. The project was going on ok, until I 
made a copy of the application, so that one copy could be used for 
testing/development and the other for real usage. But, as soon as two 
copies existed on the same server, one being requested after another, I 
noticed some strange effects:

At first, every now and then, I got a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error when 
requesting one of the two copies. I traced the error which was raised in 
apache.py, the reason being that the module's directory I was trying to 
access wasn't in the path(which is calculated from request url). I 
commented out the check, and tried again. Now the error was gone, but 
another issue arised: when requesting for example the development page, 
which has the title set to &quot;Test&quot;, instead of seeing the correct title, 
I got (seemingly randomly) titles from both the test site and the real one.

I figured that wrong modules are being used/imported and made the script 
output sys.path. The path contained both: root folder of the testing 
site and next to it root folder of the real site, which was probably the 
reason why the titles were unstable. I tried setting PythonPath, with no 
effect.

My system specs are:
- redhat linux
- httpd-2.0.46-54.ent (apache2.0)
- python-2.2.3-6.1
- mod_python-3.0.3-5.ent
- handler: mod_python.publisher

I would use Vampire, but couldn't get it to work on python2.2.

Any suggestions on how to overcome this problem really appreciated, I 
don't mind if each module is reloaded for every request, as long as it's 
the right module. (the application is using classic python import 
command for module importing)

regards,
jure
</PRE>
