Hehe it seems we have been walking on the same paths, indeed.

On my side, I changed the code to remove that original thread-state
right after a new interpreter is created.  I traced all the tstate
creations and made sure to not have any extra thread-states lying
around.  Will submit patch when I clean up the stuff.   However, I
found that trying to do remove the original thread-state from the
first interpreter results in some other error (PyDict_??? ... related
to modules, lost my log file).  In the end I just decided to leave it
for now, and not to explicitly end the main_interpreter (because at
that point it has two thread-states).  I thought of doing like you did
for the main_interpreter, with the original tstate.

Anyway, in any case, it hangs in my own custom interpreter, and not in
the main_interpreter.

My main problem is getting more info at that point, because even if I
attach a gdb to the cihld process, apache insists on sending it
SIGKILL 10 seconds later.  I just had an idea on the way to dinner,
that I could &quot;simulate&quot; finalisation by calling python_finalize from
the handler by returning a special signal number, just for this
purpose.

One other thing I did is reproduce Py_EndInterpreter within
mod_python, and it hangs on PyImport_Cleanup().  I turned up
Py_VerboseFlag and it seems to stop at the logging module.  logging
has some atexit calls, so I tried clearing that but it did not stop
the problem.  Need to look further, this is a tough bugger of a bug.

About the thread-state creation: it might be faster to eventually use
the pooling solution, rather than creating new tstates all the time,
the thread-state creation is light, but there is a small lock in
there.

cheers,
