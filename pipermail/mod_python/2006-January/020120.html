<PRE>I have been a little slow on this thread. This is something I had  
planned on emailing the list about myself.

I have a page hosted using mod_python.publisher (mod_python version  
3.2.5b) The page returns results from a PSP formatted template  
system. On a lot of pages I use a variable named &quot;info_msg&quot;

Say I login to an account, info_msg is set to 'You have logged in.'  
Go to a new page, info_msg isn't used, but the template page does  
reference it (in case it was used) and you see 'You have logged in' I  
have been trying to figure it out, but no such luck. I just found  
this thread :)

As for the &quot;MaxRequestsPerChild 1&quot; work around. How big of a  
performance hit does this give? Seems like it would slow things down  
a bit. The site I run is pretty busy.

When will 3.2.6 be available?

Thanks,

Peter

</I>&gt;<i> sub-modules they imported. 90% of code changes only affected the UI  
</I>&gt;<i> parts which were in the headers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fix was there to get changes in the library modules to become  
</I>&gt;<i> effective, without having to log in on the apache machine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As a result, the &quot;main&quot; modules as well as dependent modules will  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have been reloaded or removed (At least, the ones that came from  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my project - it would not make sense to unload modules like 'os').
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Other projects should really be run in the context of a different  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpreter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by specifying PythonInterpreter. On that basis, you would have to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be selective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if above method used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There were no other projects on that server...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So just sending &quot;<A HREF="http://myhost/pu/reload&quot;">http://myhost/pu/reload&quot;</A> to the server would  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cause the next request to get all new scripts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is only guaranteed to work if you are using mod_python on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Win32 platform.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It most definitely will not work with &quot;prefork&quot; on UNIX and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usually not on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;worker&quot; on UNIX. The reason the latter will not work reliably is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be multiple Apache child processes and your request will only  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hit one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those child processes. You would have to hit reload many times and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you wouldn't know for sure it had been done in all of the children.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True.
</I>&gt;<i> I was using Apache 2.0.something and Solaris 2.6 at the time (had  
</I>&gt;<i> to compile everything, no binary distributions), but I already  
</I>&gt;<i> forced apache to use a single-process multi-threading worker.  
</I>&gt;<i> Benchmarks showed no real difference with the prefork mpm. The  
</I>&gt;<i> machine was seriously limited by memory, and the childs would take  
</I>&gt;<i> up &gt;12 MB of memory each, most of which could be shared. Putting it  
</I>&gt;<i> into threading mode solved the memory hogging, and also had  
</I>&gt;<i> advantages in caching stuff in simple dictionaries in memory. I  
</I>&gt;<i> also did DB connection pooling, but after implementing and doing  
</I>&gt;<i> some benchmarks, there was no real performance advantage in doing  
</I>&gt;<i> it on the MySQL database, which is amazingly fast in setting up  
</I>&gt;<i> connections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting this to work on a prefork system is indeed quite a  
</I>&gt;<i> challenge...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But at the time, it was a much better option than restarting an  
</I>&gt;<i> Apache server process when hundreds of machines are using it...
