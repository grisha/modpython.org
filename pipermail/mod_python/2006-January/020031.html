Reasonable comments. Although is some cases the justification that
people give for not using third party software is a bit silly. The worst
I have seen are Debian fanatics who wil refuse to use a package if it is
not available as a Debian package. I have even seen some cases where
they wouldn't use a newer verison of mod_python because it hadn't been
packaged yet, even though it fixed the problem they were having.

For Vampire at least, it will not dissappear and I will still make it
available and support it as need be even if I don't further develop it.
If I do make it unavailable, it would only be after many many years and
I was confident no one was using it or interested in it any more. That
is the way I work, although I accept that other developers may not have
the same attitude.

If you want some evidence that I don't give up on packages completely,
check out a package called OSE (<A HREF="http://ose.sourceforge.net">http://ose.sourceforge.net</A>) some time. I
started this package in 1990 and it was first made freely available in
1993. Although I am not actively extending it, given that it is more or
less feature complete for what its purpose was, I still make the
occasional release to address issues or make minor additions. If I can
just get my documentation sorted out, I will even take the beta tag off
the latest version, but this mod_python stuff has distracted me. :-)

Overall I think the biggest problem with many third party packages is
that people who develop them come mainly from the perspective of an
application developer. They work out what is required for the
application at hand but without too much thought of structuring the
underlying layers as a good reusable framework in itself. I truly
believe that to write good reusable code you need to have a completely
different mindset and not many are really good at that. If I am going to
use a third party package, I am thus more concerned about how it is
implemented and structured. If the code inside is a piece of crap and
the developer does stop looking after it, then I would obviously have
more issues than if the code was well structured. At least if the code
is well structured one is going to have more confidence that you could
maintain it yourself if need be. Most users though aren't generally
prepared to step up and do that and just expect everything to be
provided and done for them by others.
