<PRE>Hi Saiello,

&gt;<i> I was writing one. I stopped due to my lack of experience in writing 
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python apps. A webmail app is a rather large application to be 
</I>&gt;<i> writing.
</I>
Darn - I rather hoped it would just be a case of plugging together the 
standard Python mail libs with a pretty template. I should have twigged 
- there are thousands of home-build CMS, but only a few abandonned 
Webmail apps -&gt; probably for a reason!

I found your posts to the forum last May-ish (thanks to 
<A HREF="http://mailman.modpython.org/mailman/listinfo/mod_python">grahamd at dscpl.com.au</A> for the search hints). It sounds like you got a 
fair way with it?

&gt;<i> I believed I needed more experience in writing simpler apps, and 
</I>&gt;<i> getting my programing standards down. I kept finding as I wrote more 
</I>&gt;<i> and more of the app. I would have to go back and rewrite my past 
</I>&gt;<i> functions, because I had learned better ways to go about performing 
</I>&gt;<i> that task. It was very fustrating to take One step forward and Two 
</I>&gt;<i> backwards.
</I>
That sounds like the story of my life!

&gt;<i> Another promblem was the amount of time it took to read all the RFCs 
</I>&gt;<i> and then see how so many different IMAP servers differ from one 
</I>&gt;<i> another. I basically got to the point of parsing the raw email and 
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with MIME. I was just digging into the MIME RFCs and was not 
</I>&gt;<i> looking forward to find how my everyday email somehow differed from 
</I>&gt;<i> the RFC specs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is alot of work for one person to write a good webmail app. 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially for a relative programming newbie.
</I>
True, and the thought of dealing with all the potential quirks of 
implementation isn't nice.

&gt;<i> Though of late I have been considering starting back up again
</I>
Likewise. If I can't find/build a Python solution, I will have to 
install Horde/Squirrelmail ...and if I have to do that, then I have to 
install PHP, at which point I wouldn't be able to justify using 
mod_python too. I'm not in a hurry to go back to PHP (I like what I have 
seen of mod_python), so I'm willing to give it a go, particularly if I'm 
not going to end up all alone tilting at windmills ;)

Interested in discussing it further? (License, Scope, Framework etc.). I 
can offer some basic hosting facilities if they are required.

Best wishes,
    Ed Lucas
