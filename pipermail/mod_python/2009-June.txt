I also encountered this problem. Removing php5-recode solved.

Looks like a packaging bug.

Message-ID: <bb79d4430906032131n55621977vbe04f0ac439357c3@mail.gmail.com>

I have a working test installation of mod_python.
But, the following code does not seem to run in my mod_python handler:

from mod_python import apache
import win32api
import win32com.client
shell = win32com.client.Dispatch("WScript.Shell")
shell.Run("calc")
def handler(req):
    req.content_type = 'text/plain'
    shell.Run("calc")
    req.write("Hello Wordfd2!")
    return apache.OK

Is their a security setting that turns off access to win32com, etc...?

What I really want to do is use cdll.LoadLibrary from mod_python as a bridge
to other dll's without having to compile another apache module from scratch.


Thanks.

Message-ID: <BAY103-W155153378A32272958C54BAC480@phx.gbl>


Hi all

I have been studying mod_python for a school project.I wanted to use python as my programming language.  It is about implementing all sorts of RPC protocols(from socket to SOAP,XML-RPC). There has to be only one client application but I am not sure how many servers can be. It wouldn't be too hard if I could have a server for each protocol. Anyway I wanted it to be as low-level as possible so I would have an understanding of how things work. In the end I thought if I had a ConnectionHandler as server side I could read the request decide what protocol it uses then call that procedure. This is the plan for now. Feel free to comment, I would appreciate some help

For now I can't get a ConnectionHandler working. I tried Req Handler and it worked just fine. When I try Connection Handler,I get an 'internal server error' . I did everything like it was described here: http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/pyapi-conn.html

I also added "AddHandler mod_python .py " to .htaccess but no success.  Maybe I did something wrong, couldn't find a similar problem in any mailing list

What version of mod_python are you using?

  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-102

Connection handlers are rarely used so possibly other bugs lurking in
there as well.

I get the impression you are perhaps going about this the wrong way as
you still need XML-RPC/SOAP to work over HTTP and as soon as you use
connection handlers, don't think that is possible as you are
responsible for everything. You are therefore likely better off doing
everything as a request handler. You aren't going to make anything
simpler by using a connection handler.

BTW, look around and you will already find implementations of
XML-RPC/SOAP endpoints for mod_python and newer WSGI interfaces which
can be hosted on mod_wsgi and other WSGI servers. So, you may also be
partly reimplementing the wheel.

The web server and mod_python aren't usually going to be the
bottleneck, but your application. You haven't said anything about your
application though, so cannot help.

That said, do ensure you read:

  http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2009/03/load-spikes-and-excessive-memory-usage.html

so you don't configure Apache in a silly way.

If you have a problem with ZSI, ask on their list.

It depends on what your application does.
CPU is usually not the bottleneck, unless say you resize massive images all
the time.
Look at
#vmstat 1
when you run your application, paying attention to si (swap in), so (swap
out) and especially to bi (bytes in FROM your I/O device) and bo (bytes
out). If you serve a lot of files, "bi" should ideally be almost always 0,
which means that you need to have sufficient RAM to cache ALL these files,
so that it rarely touches the disks. This is applicable to any web app
actually, even just plain apache serving static files, not just to
mod_python.

Subject: [mod_python] mod_python installation on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <4A44DD5C.20300@mapgears.com>

I'm trying to make mod_python works in a non traditional environment, 
mainly in the FGS environment (http://www.maptools.org/fgs/).  I built 
the mod_python 3.3.1 with Apache 2.2.11.  The configure switches are:

./configure --prefix=$FGS_DEV_HOME/built/mod_python \
    --with-apxs=$FGS_DEV_HOME/built/apache/bin/apxs \
    --with-python=$FGS_DEV_HOME/built/python/bin/python

I have no .htaccess file.

When I run python on the command line and try and import mod_python, I got:

nsavard@Manie:~/fgspython$ python
Python 2.6.2 (r262:71600, May 25 2009, 17:09:05)

"/home/nsavard/fgspython/lib/python2.6/site-packages/mod_python/apache.py", 
line 30, in <module>
    import _apache
ImportError: No module named _apache


It means that mod_python is installed based on what I read on the 
mailing list.  If I access mptest.py through the browser, the script 
doesn't run and outputs the error that I pasted below.  I did read most 
of what I found on Google but still searching.

Does someone have any idea of what is happening?

The relevant information is pasted below.

Thanks.

All,

Replying to myself.  This was a build error.  I built mod_python against 
python 2.5.2 first, then I updated python to 2.6.2 and rebuilt 
mod_python.  For some reasons some mod_python libraries were not 
rebuilt.  After I did "make clean" and rebuilt, everything went smoothly.

Thanks.

Norm

Why are you wanting to use output filters anyway? It is rather an
advanced part of mod_python that very very few would need. Normally
you would want to become quite familiar with core functionality of
mod_python before considering use of filters. That you are struggling
suggests you aren't particularly familiar with mod_python.

Anyway, without you finding the error in the appropriate Apache error
log and without you even describing where and how you configured
Apache and setup your Python code, hard to suggest what is wrong.

Subject: [mod_python] building mod_python with a version of python/cx_Oracle
Message-ID: <4A490C31.6000604@noaa.gov>

Hello all. I'm getting ready to ask my system admin person to rebuild 
mod_python on my server. I also need to get my DBA to install Oracle on 
my server. My question can I go ahead build *mod_python* binded to say 
Python2.6 and then_ later installed the python module cx_oracle_ without 
having to rebuild  mod_python?   I kinda didn't want to wait for my DBA 
to get mod_python up and going. Thanks.

Wayne
