If you use pso you will have env available in a neat and easy manner:

Or you can always see how in pso we get all the enviromental variables
;)



good luck,

<excerpt>Hi,


I have recently installed Python 2.2.2 and Apache 2.0.43, and have
configured a directory to execute mod_python.  The problem I have is I
do not seem to be able to access any of the environment variables in
the Request Object form object.  Below is the part of my httpd.conf
file and also the python script that I am using.


<fixed><bigger># Adding directory for python

Alias /python/ "/usr/local/apache2/mod_python/"


<<Directory "/usr/local/apache2/mod_python">

    AddHandler python-program .py

    SetHandler python-program

    PythonPath "sys.path+['/usr/local/apache2/mod_python']"

    PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

    Options +ExecCGI

    PythonDebug On

<</Directory>


</bigger></fixed>And the python function is as follows:


<fixed><bigger>def my_test(req):

  dict = req.form


  list = req.form.list


  keys = dict.keys()

  str = dict_to_str(dict)


  str = "<<H1>Test Page for FieldStorage<</H1>\n"+ str + "\nlen(list)
%d" % len(list)


  return str



</bigger></fixed>If anyone had any ideas or somewhere I can look at
some examples for using CGI Environment variables that would be really
helpful.


Thanks in advance

regards

Tim.
