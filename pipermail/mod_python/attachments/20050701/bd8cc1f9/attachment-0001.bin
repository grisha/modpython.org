<excerpt>I have spend alot of time trying to make mod_python use the
"right" version of python but it always chooses the system one in
/usr/bin/python.


I am running FC 3, Apache 2 and I want it to use /usr/local/bin/python
or the python I tell it to use. During the compilation it uses the
specified python and everything is installed in right place but when
code is run through it, it uses the system specific version.


How can I debug this? I suspect that there is something else in
apache/python/mod_python that has to be recompiled but don't know
where to look for it.
