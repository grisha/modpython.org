hi again,


I am getting closer to getting my first time mod_python install
working. The following code works:


...


# mptest.py

def say(req, what="NOTHING"):

    return "I am saying %s" % what

...


So, now I am trying to install mpservlets-1.1.5. I do get a couple
compile warnings, 'package init file '__init__.py' not found (or not a
regular file)'. However, everything after install_lib compiles fine.


When I copy the mpservlet tutorial into my webroot and set my
httpd.conf to this:


...

LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so


<<Directory  /var/www/tutorial>

   SetHandler python-program

   PythonHandler mod_python.publisher

   PythonDebug on

<</Directory>


...


and try to access the page http://localhost/tutorial/ I continually
get:


...

<fontfamily><param>Courier</param><smaller><x-tad-smaller>Mod_python
error: "PythonHandler mod_python.publisher"


Traceback (most recent call last):

I also tried http://localhost/tutorial/index.mps. Any help, please?


The first script still runs when placed in this directory.


BTW, I did see an earlier post with the same error message, however
the thread was resolved and the person was posting said they could
take it from there:
