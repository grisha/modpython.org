Hi John,


I have a solution, but I can't tell you exactly why it works, only that

it does.  There is probably a different and better way to do it.


I'm pretty new to python and by extension, mod_python, but I
encountered

your situation once before. I was trying to use "_apache.parse_qs" and

"_apache.parse_qsl".


The _apache module appears to be built-in to mod_python; furthermore,
it

seems to be directly available *only* to other modules in the
mod_python

directory.  So, in the mod_python directory I created a file,

"mp_helper.py", whose contents consist of only one line: "import

_apache".  Then, within my own application I include this line: "from

mod_python import mp_helper".


After that I was able to access parse_qs and parse_qsl as

mp_helper.parse_qs and mp_helper.parse_qsl.


Hope that is useful to you,

Mike Wright
