Subject: [mod_python] Mod python installation problems on unix
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=-jv_TJ_0j-JCNM+SCMgDNEnU=kccOOsrSsGML@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to install mod python.

Server version: Apache/2.2.16 (Unix)
Python 2.5.2
mod_pyton-3.3.1

./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
--with-python=/usr/local/bin/python2.5

while make time its is giving error

connobject.c: In function '_conn_read':
connobject.c:142: error: request for member 'next' in something not a
structure or union
apxs:Error: Command failed with rc=65536

I have used proposed patch
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-249

After these changes configure and ran make , while running i am
getting following error.

*** static library
/home/esuser/apache_test/appython/lib/python2.5/config/libpython2.5.a is not
portable!
 ld: 0706-004 Cannot find or read export file: Modules/python.exp
        ld:accessx(): No such file or directory
collect2: ld returned 255 exit status
apxs:Error: Command failed with rc=65536



Any suggestions ?

Hello All,

 

I am trying to read file from remote machine using mod_python, but I am
getting Error while using opening the file.

 

So I tried to use os.access (path, F_OK) to check for path availability from
Python IDE so it returns 'True' but when I

 

Tries the same os.access(path, F_OK) function from browser it is returning
'False'.

 

I think this function might be due to some security reasons but my
os.access() is returning true when executed from

 

Python IDE.

 

Any help regarding this will be greatly appreciated.

 

 Thanks In advance

Rahul Warhekar

Hello,

 

Ok, I will change my question.

I want to open remote servers text file using mod_python in my program, to
display file contents in browser for reading.

But I am getting result as 'FALSE' when I tried to check the availability of
that path in my program. For checking path I have used 

Os.access(path, os.F_OK) function. 

 

But for information when I used the same function with same path from Python
IDE I am getting output as 'TRUE'.

 

Please guide me with the problem. I am being stuck on this place.

 

Thanks,

Rahul Warhekar

Rahul,

If I understand correcty you want to figure out with a mod_python
program whether a text file on another webserver (which is out of your
control) exists. Correct?

> Os.access(path, os.F_OK) function.

To what I know you can't do that with the os module. You can only
check local paths an a filesystem this way. You would have to perform
an HTTP request on the webserver and interpret the result. If you get
an Error404 the file does not exist.

Does the help you?
Peter

Subject: [mod_python] getaddrinfo and getnameinfo for IPv6
Message-ID: <A3F63C4681BE75419CC0A799308910D40DE73159C9@MAILBOX.exchange.upenn.edu>

Hello,

I am running Python's socket.getaddrinfo through mod_python in order to obtain IPv6 addresses from various IPv6 capable devices. Using this setup, I consistently get the error: (8, 'node name or service name not known').   Conversely, using getnameinfo to obtain a domain name from an IPv6 address consistently returns the IPv6 address rather than the name.  These problems don't existing with name resolution for IPv4 addresses.

I have traced this problem to mod-python: running getaddrinfo in a python interpreter or though cgi works fine and returns the expected IPv6 addresses. I'm able to get around these issues by spawning a child python process, but that's messy.

Does mod_python needs to be especially built with IPv6 support? If so, how do I do this; I have not seen anything in the documentation.

Python

Thank you.

Rahul,

I believe you need to provide us with more details about the problem,
ideally example source code (relevant snippets) from your application
and directory listings (showing file modes) from the webserver you are
trying to access.

It is very difficult to help you when we have to guess the details.

Peter
