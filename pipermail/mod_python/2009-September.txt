Subject: [mod_python] Compilation Problem mod_python on AIX-5.3
Message-ID: <630412690909020418x565b9aeet637b3122c4b9d49c@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

I'm trying to compile mod_python from source on aix5.3 , i've installed
apache2.2.10 , python2.6.2 ,gcc using some pre-built packages from
pware.hvcc.edu site

the compilation process gives the following :

Sorry Dave,

seems like my combination of Ubuntu+Firefox+Hotmail is resulting in e-mails being lost in the hyperspace :P

 

Now, writting from Windows+IE :o --- this was my original e-mail:

 

I have a very small mod_python project, and I want to move it to mod_wsgi. What I need is something simple to handle the sessions (like mod_python's Session() object) and don't really care about having to use another template engine than PSP.

 

I would like to know which framework do you guys use/recommend for this situation?

 

I tried Pylons but after two days and a dissapointing "hello world" containing more than 40 files, I concluded that is not what I want...

anyways, any suggestion?

 

Best regards,

Fernando

Subject: [mod_python] Cache management in a mod_python environment
Message-ID: <1252084980.10347.20.camel@welling-laptop>

Hi folks;
  I've written a web utility which generates images in mod_python, and
I'd like to keep recently generated images in a LRU cache.  I don't
understand the threading environment, however, and if many instances of
my app try to manage the cache simultaneously they'll get it wrong.
  If I run a mod_python page under apache, each httpd ends up creating
its own instance of the mod_python program, correct?  If a given httpd
services two requests at the same time, does a separate instance of the
module get created or does the function generating the page get run in
two different threads?  Is there any data structure I can attach cache
information to that will survive between requests within the same httpd?

Thanks,
-Joel Welling

Each process has its own Python interpreter instance.

For a thread MPM such as worker MPM for Apache, multiple threads
execute in context of same interpreter and same loaded code. In single
thread prefork MPM for Apache, all requests are serialised, so not an
issue.

Within same httpd process, yes. Basically place it as global data in a
standard Python module. If multithreaded, updates and maybe reads may
need to be threaded protected of requires multiple operations which
together aren't atomic.

Have a read of:

  http://www.dscpl.com.au/wiki/ModPython/Articles/TheProcessInterpreterModel
  http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/pyapi-apmeth.html

In the latter, read about import_module() function. This is relevant
as that is what is used to handle imports of mod_python script files
and there is a section in there about preserving cached data across
reloads of the script when changes are made to script.

Hi All,

 

I have been searching to find out about the compatibel versions of Apache.msi file and Mo_Python. It has been 2 days and I have not succeeded.

 

Kindly help me. If there is any appropriate site showing all proper settings for the two kindly let me know.

Now explain what the end outcome you are trying to reach is, rather
some little detail about how you think you can achieve it. Then we may
be able to help. Not all are guru's on the intricacies of development
for Windows platform.

Did you even find:
  http://apache.mirror.aussiehq.net.au/httpd/modpython/win/3.3.1/

which is linked off the mod_python site.

That will detect what you can use, especially what version of Python as no
binaries are available for newer Python versions.

I suspect though that you don't even quite understand what mod_python does
or how it works. You seem to be wanting to tick off an item on a list and
aren't really sure what you need.

Hi list,

This e-mail is just to tell that I finally choose the framework that Geert recommended: django
It is pretty easy to learn and has a good documentation. Template system is also good. Regarding sessions, they are a little bit different, for example you don't need to lock/unlock or even save(), which is also nice.

I think that Pylons is also probably good, but my first impression was like 'this is too much for what I needed'. I guess this is what happens when you come from a background were you are used to do what you need 'by hand'.

Thanks for your suggestions!

I would like to know which framework do you guys use/recommend for this situation?
 
I tried Pylons but after two days and a dissapointing "hello world" containing more than 40 files, I concluded that is not what I want...
anyways, any suggestion?

Greetings!

I'm interested in using mod_python with a Python 3.1 application and I was
wondering is there any plans to bring out a compatible mod_python module?
Thanks!

AFAIK, no.
Have a look at mod_wsgi:

Hi All,

 

Any idea how to integrate mod php to apache 2.2.1.13?? What changes should I make in the configuration file for that??

What is the most suitable php version for apache server mentioned above and where can I download it from??

 

Thanks & Regards,

You would perhaps be better off going to ask on a PHP list.

Hello Everyone,

This is some what off-topic but i have been searching for a solution
to my unique problem (which is most of the time, why me )

I have installed FC10 32bit on a Intel P4, 256MB DDR, with 80Gb HDD,

Kernel 2.6.27

httpd-2.2.13.tar.gz

This is for my development of applications

I wanted to have Apache working with WORKER MPM , but no luck. I have
been studying on apache web site n searching the google for the past 3
weeks, no luck.

http still compiles with 'prefork'

this is what i am giving after untaring

./configure --prefix=/opt/apache2 --with-mpm=worker --with-tk
--enable-module=auth_tk --with-tcl --enable-module=auth_tcl
--enable-auth-ldap --enable-ldap --with-ldap --enable-ssl --with-ssl
--disable-prefork --enable-so --enable-threads

There is no error on compiling.

On runnign ./configure there is a line which says 'checking which mpm
to use ... worker'

# cat configure.log

shows worker mpm where ever it is required.

# cat Makefile

has a line

INSTALL_HEADERS = \
        include/*.h \
        $(srcdir)/include/*.h \
        $(srcdir)/os/$(OS_DIR)/os.h \
        $(srcdir)/server/mpm/$(MPM_SUBDIR_NAME)/*.h \
        $(srcdir)/modules/aaa/mod_auth.h \
        $(srcdir)/modules/database/mod_dbd.h \
......


When i check httpd-2.2.13/server/mpm/worker/  There is a 'worker.c'
file but not "worker.h" file. The above Makefile is looking for a *.h
file.

There are no errors at 'make' & 'make install' process.

on doing /opt/apache2/bin/httpd -l

[root@mi bin]# httpd -l
Compiled in modules:
  core.c
  prefork.c
  http_core.c
  mod_so.c
[root@mi bin]#


Please tell me / guide me where am i going wrong.... and how to go
about to have worker MPM working.

I will be doing app development using mod_python+apache.

TIA

Message-ID: <8496caf30909290608o46c02969rc3655d8164705889@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using mod_python for a while, I don't have a ton of code running
on it, but am about to write a lot more and would like to switch to
mod_wsgi.

Rewriting the underlying callables to be WSGI compliant should be fairly
simple, but i have also been using vampire to give me URLs like
https://example.com/widget/5 (grabs data for widget with id 5).

I'm wondering what the best way is to support these existing URL's but use
mod_wsgi for everything.  There are only about 10 base pages now, One
thought was to use mod_rewrite to turn that into
https://example.com/object.py?id=5

Is that they best way to handle this sort of migration?  Can i keep this
sort of URL structure with mod_wsgi? Once this is live i don't want to leave
mod_python active in apache.

Thanks,
Jeff

Why not move to django? Django does url rewriting and much, much more

For simplicity, I would suggest having a look at 'bobo'.

Dave, I'll definitely report back, a first look at bobo puts it in as a
front runner.

Message-ID: <bebb7fa10909300821g20d9574l80cb790d148b7c66@mail.gmail.com>

I need to ensure Apache is using the system path python (/usr/bin/env
python) and not /usr/bin/python.  I have a requirement to use a more
up-to-date python is a web app (2.5) than the system default python
(2.4).  Is this setable within mod_python?

(Setting /usr/bin/python to link to python 2.5 breaks many RHEL functions.)

My server is a RHEL 5 machine.

I appreciate any info.

It is not settable w/in mod_python.

You will need to install mod_python from source, explicitly configuring 
it to use Python 2.5.  Check out the README within the source code for 
mention of the --with-python configuration argument.
