<PRE>This amy appear twice.  I usually post through gmane but my post hasn't 
shown so I am directly submitting this to the list. Sorry twice if it 
becomes redundant.

I have been tasked to make a web interface to search (swish-e) and index 
of pdf's.  I have never done any programming (but have done some 
scripting) so I apologize in advance for any questions that may seen 
like common sense.  I feel like there will be many of them as this is 
very humbling to me.

I chose python to develop (and learn to program with) for numerous 
reasons.  I quickly found mod_python and chose that.  I saw the example 
site and thought it would be a nice simple site to modify (tries to 
conceal leeching noises).  I have it all up and running and somewhat 
modified but have reached an impass.

I have modified the three pages to be search, results and help.  I 
modified search_page.html to have text input and submit calls:

&lt;form action=&quot;results/performSearch&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;

I added it as a value passed (required by) to results (continued after 
bad code):

def results(req, searchWords):
    return _any_page(req, 'results')



        #def performSearch(searchWords):

    # make sure the user provided all the parameters
    if not (searchWords):
        return &quot; Nothing to search for. Nothing Found.&quot;


    # do the search
    handle = SwishE.new('/usr/local/swish-e/index.swish-e')
    search = handle.search('')
    results = search.execute(searchWords)
    return [r.getproperty('swishdocpath') for r in results]

also I have the following in results_page.html:

&lt;% print results %&gt;


I have tried with it as a call to performSearch and directly to search. 
 I have tried with different indentations.  I have also tried including 
it in the page return, but either the page returns:

name error results not defined  ## wiith the &lt;%psp%&gt; tag in html
or:
as a blank formatted results page with a broken menu and images.

I could keep playing around but I figured it was time to put down my 
pride and ask the experts.  Any help is appreciated.

TIA
reed (very newb programmer)

PS If (when) I get this working I will gladly roll it up  with a demo 
index and put it up as an example site with the original.

PSS:
FreeBSD 5.2.1
mod_python 3.1.3
python 2.3.4
SwishE 0.4
