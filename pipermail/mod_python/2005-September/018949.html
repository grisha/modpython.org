<PRE>Hi,

I am not sure whether I should start a new thread, but my issues are 
not yet solved and the subject line is still partly accurate, so I'll 
just continue.

To get my ideas working, I tried both the options that I saw in my last 
post, but I am getting stuck in both.

Let me start with the one, with which I progressed the most:
1. Don't use transhandler. Have a main.py as the PythonHandler for the 
www/root directory.

&lt;Directory /var/www/root&gt;
     SetHandler mod_python
     PythonHandler main
&lt;/Directory&gt;

---- with main.py: ----
def handler(req):
	extension = os.path.splitext(req.filename)[1]
	if extension == &quot;.html&quot; or extension == &quot;&quot;:
		if not os.path.exists(req.filename):
			... (handle further)
			return apache.OK
		else:
			if extension == '':
				req.filename = req.filename + &quot;/index.html&quot; # THIS LINE SEEMS NOT 
TO HAVE AN EFFECT
			return apache.DECLINED
	else:
		return apache.DECLINED

When a url is requested for an existent .html file, it works fine: 
apache serves the .html file itself. However if the url is only the 
name of a directory, I can't seem to give apache its normal &#8211;complete&#8211; 
behavior. (E.g. the url www.foobar.com/foo/ (assuming the directory 
foo/ exists) does not return a directory listing of the contents of 
that directory nor does it display www.foobar.com/foo/index.html if 
there is such a file.) And it seems I also can't change the filename 
anymore in that handler phase. The only solution I found was to put an 
.htaccess file in /foo/ saying &quot;SetHandler none&quot;. But I was actually 
looking for a way in which I would not need these .htaccess files when 
there is just an index.html present. Is there any way I still can set 
the filename in this phase?


Then I thought that maybe transhandler could help me in the end, but I 
got stuck with that one rather soon.
2. Using transhandler to set the filename and have it decide what 
apache should be doing.

&lt;IfModule mod_python.c&gt;
     PythonPath &quot;sys.path + ['/var/www/python/']&quot;
     PythonTransHandler translate
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

---- and from translate.py: ----

def transhandler(req):
	...
	req.filename = '/var/www/python/main.py'
	return apache.OK

The issue I run against is that now apache shows the code from main.py. 
It doesn't execute it, it just shows the code. Despite all the other 
directives I use (in httpd.conf or .htaccess). Even when I add the line 
'req.add_handler(&quot;PythonHandler&quot;, &quot;main&quot;)' to the mix, it won't execute 
main.py, just displays its code. Any ideas how to I solve this?

Many thanks,
dirk
