Message-ID: <CAHb_syt9h56xwz3ZUiAvZZhz1PAphXX63r73LW7=9AUJkoOweg@mail.gmail.com>

After a six year pause in development, I am pleased to announce the
3.4.1 release of mod_python.

Mod_python is an Apache HTTP Server module that embeds the Python
language interpreter within the server. With mod_python you can write
web-based applications in Python that are fast, scalable have access
to advanced features such as ability to maintain objects between
requests, access to httpd internals, content filters, connection
handlers and more.

The 3.4.1 release mainly addresses compatibility with Python version
up to 2.7.5 and Apache HTTP Server 2.4.4, addition of a WSGI handler
as well as many bug fixes.

Mod_python 3.4.1 is released under the Apache License version 2.0.

Information about this release, download link, documentation and more
is available at:

http://www.modpython.org/

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to and helped test
this release, without your help it would not be possible!

Regards,

Gregory Trubetskoy
