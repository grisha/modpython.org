This is a bug in your code.

If you can't handle 2 requests coming in from same session w/o  
crashing, that is a bug in your code.
Saying you dont like the solution isnt really going to help you. You  
are basically asking for a crutch
to support buggy code. Even if there was a crutch to give, it is still  
just a crutch.

You are going to have to do some form of locking. The solution of  
doing it right there in the code
as suggested is going to be the least painful way to deal with it. If  
you consider that blowing up
your code, well, then yes, you do need to blow up your code. Code that  
dies when it gets
unexpected input is bad code.

As to this:

'So what I was wondering about was if there's some sort of mechanism  
within apache or mod_python itself to simply ignore requests from the  
same user '

User is an application level term. It means nothing to something like  
mod_python, mod_perl or any other lower level tool. mod_python exists  
inside an apache process, that process and mod_python are concerned  
with connections, stateless connections I might add, not with users.
