No I haven't.  Is there a way to profile it in the context of
mod_python?  A lot of what is happening is manipulating clearsilver datasets.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Right now I do not have connection pooling-- one process, one database
connection.  If I add a second web server I am going to run out of database
processes.  My postgresql server is on FreeBSD and increasing the available
processes for postgresql on FreeBSD is a major pain.

The database is doing fine-- hardly any load at all.  All the problems seem
to be in the application realm.  Connection pooling is definitely needed.

&gt;<i>

</I>
The database load doesn't seem to be really a big problem.  There are hundred
of thousands of pages, each translated into 6 languages.  I tinkered around
with mod_cache a bit but it couldn't handle it.

You are right-- trying to profile it is probably the first order of business.

Fyi the site in question is:
