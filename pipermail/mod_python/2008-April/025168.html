</I>&gt;<i> Do you know what those processes are doing when they suck up the cpu?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it something that you could offload to another machine?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously throwing more hardware at the problem can work but it sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> your setup right now doesnt allow for a ton of movement you can do in that 
</I>&gt;<i> area.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Re-working the entire thing is one option but you might try to skate by
</I>&gt;<i> before doing that by seeing if you can move just the problem areas.
</I>
So far my technique for finding out what these processes are doing is to
observe top, copy the pid of a problem and then quickly switch over to apache
server-status output, refresh and look for the pid.  I wish I knew a better
way...

The results of this un-scientific technique do not point to a particular area
of the site.  I do know that there are 3 directory-type scripts that get
hammered by the search engines.  The site has over 400,000 records in google
and all of these pages are dynamically generated by these scripts.

I suppose I could just do some mod_proxy stuff to redirect some of these...
Not a bad idea if I could do it without affecting google rank (i.e. no visible
redirecting).  But this is still adding additional hardware.  If adding a
dual cpu system would buy me the same performance boost I could end of life
the current machine and my monthly fees would be less than 2 single cpu
machines.  Not that the fees are a big concern-- mostly I am interested in
the simplest setup.  1 machine and no mod_proxy seems simpler.

I have no experience with dual cpu machines though-- this is part of my
concern.  I manage 6 production FreeBSD servers but they are all single cpu
systems.  If apache is in prefork mode 2 cpus is just extra processing power
right?!?
