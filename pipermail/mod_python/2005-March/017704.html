Not really. You seem to know where the specific error comes from, so maybe
you can add debugging to understand the context in which it is being
executed and develop a very cut down example which demonstrates the
problem and which isn't dependent on any third party packages. If you can
do that and others can duplicate it then we might be able to help investigate.

I have already gone back and tried the original example which you cited:

  <A HREF="http://www.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2005-January/017129.html">http://www.modpython.org/pipermail/mod_python/2005-January/017129.html</A>

However, I didn't have any problem running the example on my platform so
can't even use that as a basis for any investigation.

I also managed to fix yesterday the problem in the code I was talking about where
I personally was having issues with restricted mode, but overall I am still not
any further along in really understanding in general what causes Python to run
in restricted mode. Would need to do some more research about it when I have
the time.
