<PRE>Dear all.

This mail is really directed at the developers so I hope there are some 
of you listening.  I would have preferred to enter this in a bug 
tracker of some sort, but I couldn't find a relevant URL on the 
website.  Anyway.

I have just spent 5 days battling with what i probably the most 
annoying bug I have ever come across!  For the last week I have been 
trying to work out why the hell I couldnt' get a working install of 
mod_python on OS X and I have tried _everything_.    I had managed to 
get it up and running once or twice, but then I would attempt to tweak 
my Apache config to set things up for the sw i wanted to use (trac) and 
it would die again.  The logs showed absolutely nothing of use even 
with PythonDebug on.

The bug I have discovered basically boils down to a tiny thing that is 
not an easy thing to discover.  If you use `apachectl restart` to 
control the execution of Apache with mod_python installed on OS X 
(server at least, I didnt try the client version but I imagine it will 
be the same), you will find mod_python ceases to function, producing a 
500 error from apache.

As I say , this is not an easy bug to discover, since you never expect 
there to be a difference in the way  a module behaves due to such an 
obscure thing.  I can confirm that this happens on OS X Server 10.3.6-8 
with various different builds of apache2.  I used the stock build, a 
custom built version (from the latest sources) and one from dports with 
the same results.  I also tried different versions of python (The stock 
2.3 Framework, 2.4 built as a framework, 2.4 normal, 2.3 normal....) as 
I had read on these lists that there are some oddities in this area on 
OS X.    Same results.  Just as I was beginning to give up completely I 
worked out what was going on. :p

Bottom line is that i dont want anyone to have to go through the pain I 
went through this week trying to get to the bottom of this issue.  I 
feel 10 times better now I know what the problem is, and for the time 
being the solution is to simply issue a `stop` followed by a `start` 
when i need to change the configuration of the server.  I hope this 
email at least finds it's way to the archives so that fellow OS X 
travellers can learn from my experience as there really is practially 
nothing relating to mod_python on os x on the web.  /me wishes apple 
would have just bundled it in....

I really hope however that my findings can be investigated further so 
that the bug can be resolved and a fix can be rolled into the trunk.

I am happy to do any further testing if a patch is added by anyone.  I 
would like to try myself, but I just don't have the time to get further 
into this stuff.

Many thanks

ps.  At this stage I have only reported the bug to you guys since the 
apache bug tracker asks you to specifically verify that the bug isnt 
related to a module - lets make sure that mod_python isnt at fault 
first and then pass it to the main apache guys if not.
