<PRE>(First of all, a big thanks to Graham for putting up with a thinly 
veiled attempt of escapism from Too Many Mailing Lists syndrome. :) That 
said, no offense to him, the e-mail he forwarded really wasn't mailing 
list material: I just wanted a quick second opinion to make sure I was 
sane.)


I was working with my own custom handler when I ran into a random 
roadblock: for some reason the headers of submitted forms were being 
eaten, and I'm not using mod_python.publisher! With req.read() returning 
blank strings, it was obvious that util.FieldStorage(req) wasn't going 
to be of much use. I also tried a simple test, which offered some very 
bizarre results. I changed the top of my handler to the following:

def handler(req):
     test = req.read()
     req.log_error(test)

And this is what I get whenever I try to POST to it:

[Wed Mar 16 19:27:53 2005] [error] [client X.X.X.X] GET, referer: 
<A HREF="http://real.url/nothere">http://real.url/nothere</A>

Very interesting, GET instead of POST. Maybe my HTML was at fault? I 
wrote up a small test form that was *nothing* but a good form: same result.



At my wit's end, I wrote a quick handler from scratch and placed it into 
the same environment. I didn't restart Apache, all I did was make a copy 
of __init.py__ and overwrite it with a simple test. Interestingly 
enough, the &quot;handler from scratch&quot; worked as expected: req.read() 
returned a non-empty string, and req.method returned &quot;POST&quot;.

I overwrote __init.py__ again with the original version, and reran the 
same form. ...Back to GET again. It makes no sense! It's like something 
upstream is &quot;eating&quot; req.read(), but how is that possible when I'm 
fetching the contents of req.read *at the start* of my handler(req) 
function?

Here's my Apache configuration for the virtual host in question, if it 
helps:

&lt;VirtualHost 69.15.43.130:80&gt;
ServerName foo.bar.baz
DocumentRoot /not/a/real/path
   &lt;Directory /not/a/real/path&gt;
    PythonDebug On
    SetHandler mod_python
    PythonHandler handler
    &lt;IfModule mod_access.c&gt;
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;



(I'd share the code in question, but it's going to be placed in a secure 
environment and I can't have it archived to the mailing list. I'll 
report my results when I find the culprit, but in the meantime I'd 
appreciate feedback on what people think might be going wrong.)
