I routinely perform DoS attacks on my home network, usually whenever 
there is a new Knoppix or Slackware release. :) Even with DSL, the 
effect on my throughput can be severe enough that I usually run these 
tasks overnight. The mirrors I use are meant to support a one-to-many 
relationship, but some of them are under a strain simply returning such 
large files and there is a limit to how many simultaneous connections 
they can support. Can you imagine if the situation was reversed, and 
everyone was *uploading* an ISO? Clearly there is a difference, which 
you can simulate somewhat by trying to download several ISOs to one 
machine.

You're right that uploading files via a browser is useful, and I 
incorporate it regularly in applications for nontechnical users, but I 
can't think of a single server I admin on which I would consider using 
HTTP for ISO uploads. This implies a technical use that is appropriate 
for FTP, or rsync or compressed scp/sftp if the users have shell accounts.

&gt;<i> Another example is uploading a zipped-up directory of photographs for a
</I>&gt;<i> photo gallery, rather than go through an individual file upload for each
</I>&gt;<i> one. HTTP can be very good at these sorts of things, while FTP can be
</I>&gt;<i> hazardous at best.
</I>
Many transfer protocols are optimized for improved bandwidth usage and 
data integrity, both areas that aren't as well supported in HTTP uploads 
(will your browser automatically gzip your ISO or report server-side 
errors?).

The main problem with FTP is that it's a multiport protocol, which is 
out-of-place in today's firewalled world. It's still better than HTTP 
because it provides better feedback about the destination and supports 
many more commands. Security concerns can be minimized by chrooting 
users to home directories. But, yes, FTP generally sucks and sftp gives 
away the store by requiring a shell account. WebDAV is still immature 
and requires many layers of administration. It will be nice when someone 
develops a simple, secure transfer protocol that isn't attacked by the 
RIAA or used as a virus distribution mechanism.
