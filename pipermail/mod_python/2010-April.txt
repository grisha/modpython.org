Subject: [mod_python] Debugging mod_python errors - publisher.py
Message-ID: <u2k7c956f0c1004240433h7cca4452t1bf6b9ed1868747d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am using mod_python for developing web applications and here is one
strange error that is occuring that I couldn't debug.

<snip>
Mod_python error: "PythonHandler mod_python.publisher"

Description: Python-embedding module for Apache 2
 The mod_python module supports web applications written in Python.
 Because the parser is embedded in the server as an Apache module, it
 will run much faster than traditional CGI.
 .
 This package is built for the current Python version.

Python-Version: 2.5

I am using Cheetah templating and all I am doing is trying to pass
dictionaries of dictionaries to the template. Any insights into when
and why this error would occur will be really helpful.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [mod_python] Trying to learn mod_wsgi - any code samples or
	tutorials?
Message-ID: <4BD6C49C.7050802@rd.bbc.co.uk>

I've used mod_python in the past, but since I believe it's now 
deprecated in favour of mod_wsgi, I'd like to use the latter for my next 
web app.

Unfortunately, whereas mod_python had extensive documentation and 
tutorials available online, for mod_wsgi I've been unable to find 
anything more sophisticated that "Hello world". Does anyone know where 
there's some example code I could look at?

The mod_wsgi module is a means of hosting any Python web framework or
application that supports the WSGI interface. The mod_wsgi module
isn't a framework in itself whereas mod_python is in part due to its
high level handlers.

Thus, what you should be doing is simply selecting any of the separate
Python web frameworks that support WSGI and use them, following their
specific documentation.

The more popular full featured frameworks are Django, TurboGears,
Pylons, CherryPy and web2py. At the other end are WSGI component
libraries such as Werkzeug and Paste, which you can use to construct a
custom framework specific to your needs. There are also now micro
frameworks such as Flask.

So, have a look at those.

You can find a large list of other WSGI supporting frameworks at:

  http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/Frameworks

You will also find various articles about WSGI at:

  http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/Learn_WSGI

Start your investigations with WSGI itself:

http://www.wsgi.org/wsgi/

mod_wsgi is an apache module that supports the WSGI interface, so it's 
not a complete analog to mod_python.

I have played with Werkzeug and I really like it.  However, if it is 
documentation you want Pylons might be the way to go.  There is a free 
book at http://pylonsbook.com/en/1.1/ copyright circa 2009.
