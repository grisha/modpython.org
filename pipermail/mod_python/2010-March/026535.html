Thanks for the tip, That would have been a real huge problem.

I didn't make any quantitative measurements. Here's what I observed:

Browsing this page with the &quot;broken&quot; configuration took approximately 1min to load all of the thumbnails. In the &quot;fixed&quot; configuration it loads instantly. N.B. that I'm looking at this over 100Mbit LAN.

The thread Martin pointed to seemed to conjecture that the problem has to do with apache under FreeBSD being single threaded and thus depending on libc.so while a threaded python and thus a mod_python built to use it depends on libc_r.so. I believe the thread mentions a patch by you but it may be a different Graham.

     <A HREF="http://osdir.com/ml/apache.mod-python.devel/2008-10/msg00000.html">http://osdir.com/ml/apache.mod-python.devel/2008-10/msg00000.html</A>

I confess that I didn't understand the whole thing. What I took from it is that I'm going to have problems using a non-threaded apache with a threaded mod_python. I tested this conjecture by building a fresh FreeBSD install with fresh installs of apache 2.0.63, python2.6 and mod_python. And I can make the problem appear and disappear by simply changing the configuration of the python 2.6 build from threaded to non-threaded. I feel that I may have the logic about the reason wrong. I think its a weird libc.so vs libc_r.so issue. But I'm confident that I've trapped the problem. 

To tell the truth it doesn't matter. My end goal is to run Django and nowadays Django want's mod_wsgi so I'm moving over there. What I'm learning talking to you is that as far as performance goes python want's a worker MPM apache which php cannot do. 

One of the things I did yesterday was download NetBSD 5.0.2 Sparc64 which I can use on my Netra T1 downstairs. Perhaps my solution is to just build a separate webserver for my python/Django needs?
