<PRE>Lu/Ruben and others.

Some things I am working on...

I have set up a SourceForge project called &quot;mptomwsgi&quot; and it can be found on <A HREF="http://mptomwsgi.sourceforge.net">http://mptomwsgi.sourceforge.net</A>
Please be patient, it has a CVS but no code uploaded yet.

I have to do some work on the Session.Py since I forgot to mention I use SQLAclhemy and my mptomwsgi version is using that.
The nice thing about SQLAlchemy (Database to Object mapper) is that it works on any Python DBAPI compatibe database. I have a MySQL Session object added to the original version too but that one is dependent on MP for now, I have to merge the two.

At this point I have a seemingly good working Req object, with support for register_cleanup.
I have no real Python package yet, and this adapter CANNOT be installed when Mod_Python is on the system since you will have to copy the files to the: python/site-packages/mod_python directory (for code compatibility)

you will get a sample index.wsgi and there you will have to do: import your_original_module_with_handler as app.

Can you (Lu/Ruben) send me a message with what parts of MP you use and what OS you are on so I can work out what I have to do to help you with reasonable documentation?
Some hints:
Authentication
stuff from mod_python.util like fieldstorage (which might just work, I just do not know at the moment)
Are you using SQLAlchemy?
etc.

Be aware that I do not have looked into publisher (never ever used it), I have to bother Graham with that but for now I will not support that.

Updates will follow soon!

Martijn

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This code is free to use by anybody (Be aware it should be GPL or so). At the moment there is no CVS or License simply because I do not have the time to set stuff like that up (never did that before). I just started coding Python with Eclipse and Pydev as preparation on starting CVS use.
