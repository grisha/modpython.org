<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for your help. Just wanted to point out that, out of frustation, i installed mod_python 3.2.10 and discarded mod_python 3.3.1 and magically it all works fine !!!

What I would like to conclude from this is, that there might be some dependency in 3.3.1 that caused havoc...(atleast for me). As pointed out previously, 3.3.1 constantly kept on giving the following errors:

child pid 28468 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
[Tue Mar 27 17:26:14 2007] [notice] child pid 28469 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
[Tue Mar 27 17:26:40 2007] [error] [client 134.96.24.83] File does not exist: /opt/lampp/htdocs/favicon.ico
[Tue Mar 27 17:29:21 2007] [error] [client 134.96.24.83] File does not exist: /opt/lampp/htdocs/favicon.ico


Why this segmentation error with 3.3.1 and also, i had nothing to do with this favicon.ico. I do not have this icon and do not intend to make one. Why and which process needs this icon... *wondering*

Thanks,
Sikander

To confirm whether that is necessary, set:

  PythonHandler mod_python.testhandler

In the output from that just verify that the sys.path information is
correct for the version of Python you expect to use. From the above
log entries there probably isn't a problem with versions as mod_python
will actually log some warnings if it finds a different version of
Python than what it was compiled with and that isn't in the log
entries.

&gt;<i> ****Why is it loading the module twice ...is that normal ???
</I>
Note how the 'pid' is different for each. This means that there were
two requests and that they so happened to be handled by different
Apache child processes.

&gt;<i> Kindly let me know if something rings a bell.
</I>
Since you are using Python 2.5, it should not be the expat version
problem as Python 2.5 is supposed to change things to avoid that one.
I would though still suspect that it is some versioning problem with
shared libraries. For example, if your web application uses some sort
of database and you also have PHP loaded and it is using some
different version of the database client library. This sort of
mismatch can cause a crash as one library will take precedence over
the other and if they are not compatible it can crash.

What you may need to do is start adding debug into your code and the
framework it uses such that you output a log message before and after
every module import. For example:

  from mod_python import apache

  apache.log_error(__file__  + &quot; #1&quot;)
  import pyexpat
  apache.log_error(__file__ + &quot; #2&quot;)
  import module2
  apache.log_error(__file__ + &quot; #3&quot;)

See how many of the messages come out in the Apache error log and slow
narrow it down to a specific module being importer causing the crash.

If the module imports aren't the problem but something in handler
itself, do something similar, logging messages to the Apache log until
you find exactly what call causes it.
