Sounds accurate enough, except I consider them unnecessary quirks
instead of shortcomings.   I recently gave MySQL a real chance
(in a real app) and yes, you can work with/around all the quirks, but it's
stupid that you have to *know* about (read:trip over) all of them first -
what are RDBMSes for if not the convenience, y'know?
(Not speed, for one, and yet that seems the reason for many of
 MySQL's oddities, which is the reason I have trouble taking it seriously)

But talking about convenience: phpmyadmin is useful, while phppgadmin
is currently hopeless, which is relevant to database servers you don't have
admin control over, since they're typically a pain to poke around.
I've been using postgres for almost all serious things, but for my quick
proof-of-concept projects even on my own server I use mysql
because of just this.

Back to the list/subject:
'course, the MySQLdb module has an annoying quirk in unicode behaviour
until recent versions. I had to write a wrapper around it or have it bork on
still semi-current versions.

I believe SQLObject does some similar wrapping, by the way.
