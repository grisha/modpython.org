</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When you say cookies, are these cookies being constructed using Django's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; infrastructure for creating them?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Correct it's the sessionid cookie created by Django.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Further, is the request object a mod_python
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; request object or a Django request object wrapper?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the previously attached log the request is Django request.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And the modpython request is the actual modpython request.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I found weird is that the same mod_python request serviced two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different clients at different times, but perhaps that makes sense for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preforked apache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just to clarify your terminology, it is the same mod_python *instance*
</I>&gt;<i> servicing 2 different client requests. And no, it is not weird, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather the whole point of mod_python. Well maybe not the *whole* point,
</I>&gt;<i> but a very important one. :) In the simplest case you get one python
</I>&gt;<i> interpreter per apache child process, thus avoiding the overhead of
</I>&gt;<i> creating a new interpreter for each request.
</I>
It was the same child process (that much makes sense too me too), but
it also had the same address for modpython request object. Which I
thought is little weird since if request comes from address A it
should not be the same as if it comes from address B.
But the python id is just a memory address so it is possible that it
was just reusing the same memory space.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; At this point it sounds like it may be a Django issue if you are using it as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it merely uses mod_python as a jumping off point and doesn't tightly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; integrate with mod_python and use its cookies or sessions and provides
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; users with their own request object wrapper as far as I know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That was my first thought as well, and I reviewed our and django
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session handling the best I could. I found nothing unusual. In fact we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have not touched the way django handles the sessions and cookies at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all. I tried the django users group nobody seems to have similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems, I even talked to one of the django's main devs he has no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clue either.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That said, as a start I would strongly recommend that you upgrade to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; mod_python 3.2.10 and see if your problems go away.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll try that but I already tried upgrading from debian to gentoo and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from python2.3 to python2.4 and I had the same problem on both. I know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that would mean that it is something in our code ... but I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changed anything ... oh the headache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A little light just went off in my head. Is it always *exactly* the same
</I>&gt;<i> session id being served up for *all* requests?
</I>
No 99% of the time all work works normally.
User A comes along gets his own cookie user B comes along gets her own
cookie ... and then in one moment user A gets the cookie that belongs
to user B. While B user still gets her own cookie. Then user A notices
that suddenly his username changed from Joe to Suzy and starts sending
rather angry emails, which I cannot really blame him for.
The problem seems to appear more often if the site is under heavier load.

&gt;<i> There was a similar thread awhile ago where somebody was getting messed
</I>&gt;<i> up md5sums and bad session id's with Django. IIRC it was some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> library conflict between md5.so and libmhash.so. Take a look in the mail
</I>&gt;<i> archives and see if you can find some help there:
</I>
I looked at it I don't have libmash and my keys look like this
03d7f9b948174de277941ecf67feb7ee
which seems normal to me.
I went over the django code and I see that they make sure to
1. randomize the cookie key
2. check if such key exists in db before they send it to user in a cookie.
