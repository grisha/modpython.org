I am replying back on the mailing list as I think the answer is important
enough that everyone knows it.

That is that I am more than happy to see people contribute to the community
based mod_python wiki, and that means anyone. Personally I am quite flat out as
it is and taking on additional responsibility of trying to look after that wiki
or contribute to it is just more than I can handle. My lack of time at present is
already delaying the next version of mod_python as it is.

So, for anyone who doesn't know, there is a mod_python wiki available at:

  <A HREF="http://wiki.apache.org/mod_python/">http://wiki.apache.org/mod_python/</A>

Anyone can create an account and contribute to this wiki. It is not restricted
to just those who do code development on mod_python itself. I would love to see
a few people at least take it on board to try and develop the wiki further than
it is and collect material from the mailing lists and elsewhere and add it to
the wiki so there is a central repository for such contributed stuff.

At the moment the only person doing stuff with the wiki is Deron Meranda and I
am sure he wouldn't mind some help. If people do start adding stuff, then I'd
have no problem with occasionally casting an eye over it and commenting on or
fixing anything which I think might be wrong. When it comes though to setting
up the structure and getting stuff into it though, that is where I don't have time.

Graham
