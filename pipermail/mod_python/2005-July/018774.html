</I>Then take that up with redhat people, not with us, why are you whining 
about redhat policies to us?  Making you install a &quot;-devel&quot; package, 
which contains link libraries and include files for any software you 
want to compile/link against is just plain stupid.

Debian nor Slackware, both of which I've used, don't have this 
limitation: you install &quot;python&quot;, and it contains all you need for 
runtime, and all you need to compile against.

And &quot;you should never have to install -devel packages on a production 
server&quot; is absolutely no reason at all.  There's absolutely nothing in a 
-devel package which will make a production server unstable.  And if 
you're worried about someone getting inside the server and then &quot;having 
the tools to build something&quot;, well, that's just dumb, by the time the 
cracker's inside the machine it's already way too late.

&gt;<i>This system also has python-1.5.2 installed on it, which is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>So don't replace it.

&quot;mod_python&quot; doesn't load &quot;/usr/bin/python&quot;, so you don't need that file 
while running.  Rename it to something else, symlink your &quot;python2&quot; to 
&quot;/usr/bin/python&quot;, build mod_python, restore /usr/bin/python.  Seems 
simple enough.

&gt;<i>Finally, in order to even get mod_python to work, I had to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Modifying a Makefile wasn't categorized as &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; in 
development circles, last time I checked...

&gt;<i>It just seems plain messy to me, especially in a production

</I>There you have it, do it in a development environment and copy to your
