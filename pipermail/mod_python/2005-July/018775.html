-devel/-dev packages aren't unique to Redhat, my Debian systems have
them too.  So does Solaris, HP-UX and AS400 systems, iirc.

</I>
That is not true.  In order to compile and install mod_python you need
Apache's axps which is in a -devel on Redhat and -dev on Debian. 

&gt;<i> And &quot;you should never have to install -devel packages on a production 
</I>&gt;<i> server&quot; is absolutely no reason at all.  
</I>
Agreed, although some would differ (see your next comment).

&gt;<i> There's absolutely nothing in a -devel package which will make a 
</I>&gt;<i> production server unstable.  
</I>
..opps, I can't agree with you here.  -dev/-devel packages contain a LOT
of un-vetted scripts and code that could potentially be exploited.  Look
no further than Microsoft to see tons of examples of this.

&gt;<i> And if 
</I>&gt;<i> you're worried about someone getting inside the server and then &quot;having 
</I>&gt;<i> the tools to build something&quot;, well, that's just dumb, by the time the 
</I>&gt;<i> cracker's inside the machine it's already way too late.
</I>
You are out in left field a bit on this.  The additional un-tested
(rarely tested?) components present alternative avenues to gain info.
Remember printenv?  Root'ing a box is not the only way to compromise
data.

&gt;<i> &gt;This system also has python-1.5.2 installed on it, which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;/usr/bin/python, due to rpm-python and yum requirements. So,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;replacing /usr/bin/python breaks other things, including
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;production server policies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> So don't replace it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mod_python&quot; doesn't load &quot;/usr/bin/python&quot;, so you don't need that file 
</I>&gt;<i> while running.  Rename it to something else, symlink your &quot;python2&quot; to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/usr/bin/python&quot;, build mod_python, restore /usr/bin/python.  Seems 
</I>&gt;<i> simple enough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Finally, in order to even get mod_python to work, I had to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;edit src/Makefile (added -DEAPI)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Modifying a Makefile wasn't categorized as &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; in 
</I>&gt;<i> development circles, last time I checked...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It just seems plain messy to me, especially in a production
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;environment.  It's ok to have to do this in a development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;only environment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> There you have it, do it in a development environment and copy to your 
</I>&gt;<i> production environment.
</I>
You are missing my points.  If it is a messy development effort it
become messy to maintain over time, which leads to messy production
systems.  Editing a Makefile, tweaking a script, installing a -devel pkg
are not problems, they are just *more* things to track and carry over
for the next mod_python (in this case) release 6mos, 12mos, 2yrs, etc.
