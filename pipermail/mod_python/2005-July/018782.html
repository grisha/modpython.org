If I recollect properly, the separate python-devel package only  
contains the
&quot;config&quot; directory and &quot;include&quot; files. This &quot;config&quot; directory  
contains a
makefile and other bits that could be used to create your own static  
Python
binary with your own extensions statically linked in. The makefile in  
that
directory is also consulted by the &quot;distutils&quot; modules which  
practically all
Python related packages use to perform installation of a Python package.

Can't remember if the absence of the &quot;config&quot; directory will prevent  
a pure
Python package being installed using &quot;distutils&quot;, but if the &quot;config&quot;  
directory
or &quot;include&quot; directory are missing, you most definitely can't build  
or install a
Python package which has C/C++ code based extensions that have to be
compiled against Python, ie., like mod_python.

I somewhat doubt that the non-english and non-unicode encoders were
in the python-devel package as they have nothing to do with development
and would very much need to be a part of the main runtime package.

I haven't touched a Linux system in years, but it was an annoyance that
some Linux distributions had this separate python-devel package as it
meant you had to go find the extras CD to install even the most  
trivial of
Python packages. :-(
