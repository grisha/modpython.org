They are not exclusive &quot;limitations&quot; of Redhat, and the argument is
easily won when defining the differences between what a secure
production system is and what a development box is.

&gt;<i> Some platforms do not support customization as well as 
</I>&gt;<i> others. 
</I>
This isn't a customization issue at all.  It's a compilation and
development issue.  One example: mod_python switched meaning of
--with-python somewhere between here and there (but nobody readily
documented this in such a fashion that even complex goggling would
reveal).  Another:  even though python2 existed at the time, the
mod_python Makefile from v2.7.11 hardcodes /usr/bin/python signifying
that the developers never thought/intended for it to work with python2. 

&gt;<i> If you want to compile software from scratch, you need the

</I>&gt;<i> other packages. You can set up a development machine, compile the 
</I>&gt;<i> software, then transfer the results to your production environment. 
</I>
That is *exactly* my systems layout.  Dev work is done locally and
released after testing to production systems.  Unfortunately, local dev
work is not proceeding well as previously outlined.

&gt;<i> But when you do this, you are deviating from the philosophy and losing some 
</I>&gt;<i> of the benefits of your platform. You are better off upgrading or 
</I>&gt;<i> switching platforms.
</I>
...or the applications.  All I am trying to do is get python and
python2, from the same era, working with mod_python and apache releases
also from the same era.  Latest and &quot;greatest&quot; isn't necessary as
necessary functionality exists in the versions I am using (other than w/
mod_python).
