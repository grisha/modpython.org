Subject: [mod_python] Is compatible: mod_python 3.3 and python 2.7
Message-ID: <70b5b17a.4f54778.4c876513.ac29f@o2.pl>

Hi everybody,

I had upgraded mod_python to 3.3.1-11.i686 and python from 2.6 to 2.7,
and I have 'sefmentation fault',

I checked every trick to remove some apache mods like wsgi, mysqldb etc,
but errors still exists,

so I have a question is mod_python compatible with python 2.7?

If yes, what can I check, because I read many tricks which should help,
but in my situation problem still exist.

regards,
