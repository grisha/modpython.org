<PRE>Hi Grisha,

&gt;<i> Basically, the publisher doesn't have a &quot;default&quot; method name. (There is
</I>&gt;<i> no particular reason for this, it just didn't occur to me at the time of
</I>&gt;<i> writing.)
</I>
Wouldn't it be a nice idea to provide such a default method name? (&quot;main&quot;
seems a good name for that task.)

I am very keen on organizing my web projects nicely, so I usually structure
the application using separate file for separate tasks.

I also like to obey a couple of web-design paradigmas such as &quot;let your URLs
be hackable&quot;, which says nothing less than when the user modifies the URL
there shouldn't be an &quot;unexpected behaviour&quot; as a result. I do get a little of
a headache when I think of users removing the &quot;/dothis&quot; from a
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com/myscript/dothis&quot;">http://www.mydomain.com/myscript/dothis&quot;</A> and then getting a &quot;404 Not Found&quot;.  :-(

I have the feeling that this is really a point that presents a huge
understanding problem to novices, to mod_python beginners, (even if they are
perfectly familiar to Python).
Python scripts begin a the start of the file, everything is processed
sequentially. Why not having a default starting point for mod_python scripts?

Grisha, what was/is your motivation to omit the &quot;.py&quot; in the URL at the end
of the script's filename? - Don't get me wrong, I do see the beauty in this
solution (since the &quot;.py&quot; hits the eye), but isn't this arguably? Wouldn't a
CGI-style processing (&quot;..../myscript.cgi?opt1=abc&quot;) be more straight forward?

I would be really happy seeing mod_python to be that easy to understand and
easy to use (to write applications) that it might be a real alternative to
PHP, JSP and ASP, and still (with Python a its base) being a language where
beautiful and well structured code emerges from.

&gt;<i> There is probably more than one way to accomplish something to that
</I>&gt;<i> extent, one way would be to try a redirect, something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Redirect /index.py <A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com/index.py/index">http://www.mydomain.com/index.py/index</A>
</I>
Apache's module mod_rewrite might be some kind of workaround to this. But is
this really satisfying? How do other programmers feel about this?

Cheers, Peter

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi there!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a little bit of understand problem of how the architecture of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mod_python web application (say web site, if you want) should be.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to have the URLs as if the mod_python scripts were simply
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kind of &quot;special HTML documents&quot;, comparable to PHP scripts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, I have written a script named &quot;index.py&quot; which is located
</I>&gt;<i> on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document root. So I would expect &quot;<A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com/index.py&quot;">http://www.mydomain.com/index.py&quot;</A> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; execute my script (I have set up my Apache so that I can omit the
</I>&gt;<i> filename, too).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But it doesn't. When I remove the &quot;.py&quot; at the end there is no change to
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So what I have to do is to execute
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com/index/method&quot;,">http://www.mydomain.com/index/method&quot;,</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provided a method called &quot;method&quot; in my script. This way it works. - But
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there a way to have &quot;HTML-like&quot; or &quot;PHP-like&quot; behavior? Or how do I have
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organize my scripts so that I can have my whole website written in
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and can run it with &quot;<A HREF="http://www.mydomain.com&quot;">http://www.mydomain.com&quot;</A> alone?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does anyone have a good example about how to do this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks in advance!
