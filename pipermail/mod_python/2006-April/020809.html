They are there to support session locking. You will have a possible 
conflict if you are using sessions and want to &quot;borrow&quot; a lock for other 
purposes.

&gt;<i> So I have a few questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Despite my misgivings at using private interfaces, it would
</I>&gt;<i> simplify my life greatly if I could use these functions. Is it
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable to assume that, even if they are private, they will exist

</I>
The locks are actually used for 2 separate purposes: Session locking and 
serializing access to the dbm file for DbmSession. Lock index 0 is 
reserved for accessing the dbm file. Locks 1 to MAX_LOCKS are used for 
locking the actual sessions, where the lock index is derived from a hash 
of the session id.

As long as  you don't use DbmSession you can safely use lock index 0. eg.

_apache._global_lock(server, None, 0)

Note that you'll still be able to use FileSession, since it does use 
index 0.

I think you can assume that this interface will not change in the near 
future. When I was working on FileSession there was quite a bit of 
discussion on alternative locking mechanisms, but even if the 
implementation is changed in the future to improve performance I can't 
imagine why the interface would change.

&gt;<i> 2. If it is not reasonable, what suggestions do you have for
</I>&gt;<i> implementing concurrent access to a resource from (potentially)
</I>&gt;<i> multiple interpreters and/or child processes?
</I>
You could always use a filelock. Not the most efficient way to do it, 
but it would work. See portalocker.py for ideas.

&gt;<i> 3. If it _is_ reasonable....any chance that this can become a
</I>&gt;<i> documented mod_python feature? :)
</I>
Hmmm... I think it's a little too much of a hack to go in the offical 
documentation - bit too much like handing someone a loaded gun.
