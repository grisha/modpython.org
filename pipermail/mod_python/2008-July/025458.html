<PRE>For reasons unknown, I am having a go at fixing:

  <A HREF="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-217">http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-217</A>
  <A HREF="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-177">http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MODPYTHON-177</A>

One of the problems in making these changes and in the maintainability
of the mod_python code base is that it still tries to support a Python
installation that has deliberately not had thread support built in.

&gt;<i>From what I have seen it has now been many years since any
</I>distribution has deliberately disabled threading in Python. Last
platform to do it were some of the BSD platforms, but these days they
build with threaded Python as far as I know.

Consequently, I would like to drop the code which supports a non
threaded Python installation. This would get rid of a whole bunch of
#if conditionals and code variants and make making changes to Python a
lot easier. As is, don't know that the unthreaded code has even been
tested for a release since 3.1.X days and thus it may not even work
anyway.

Because of this and nature of changes being made, would also like to
bump version for mod_python in subversion up to 3.4.X as it isn't
going to be a trivial bug fix relative to 3.3.1.

Comments.
