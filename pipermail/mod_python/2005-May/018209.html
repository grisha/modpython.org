I expect we'll see less of this when Debian Sarge goes stable. Woody 
still has a very large installed base. Another challenge is that 
Slackware still ships with apache 1.3.x, and some people even prefer it 
to apache 2. That leaves mod_python 2.7 the only choice for many people. 
  While apache 2 has some nice features, the truth is that most people 
were so content with the earlier series, they are in no hurry to 
upgrade.
