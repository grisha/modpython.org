I don't think there is any kind of standardized mod_python configuration 
that has turned out to be one-size-fits-all. I rely on tweaking 
httpd.conf a lot (and restarting apache), which is not an option in most 
shared hosting environments. Running your own server (real or virtual) 
is a different case entirely. You control what's installed, so what your 
provider supports is irrelevant.

&gt;<i> I just  read
</I>&gt;<i> that hosts/admins do not like persistent long-running processes.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> assume this has to do with server load and stability and not security?
</I>
All admins expect apache to be a long running process. And, again, if 
you have a dedicated server, you're the admin, so you can do what you 
want. But you should be aware that mod_python doesn't necessarily create 
a single persistent interpreter that's shared by all applications. There 
may be a few interpreters running at a time, with their own set of 
cached modules, and they will die and be replaced after a while (I use 
the apache prefork MPM, where this is the norm, I'm not sure how much 
things change under a threaded MPM, which also has issues).

</I>
If you are comfortable administering your own server, look for a colo or 
virtual server account. Then you can do whatever you want. I doubt if 
you'll have any luck in a shared hosting environment, although there are 
some that give each user their own instance of apache and proxy it 
behind a main apache web server. No matter what you do, it's well worth 
digging an old machine out of the trash and installing Linux on it as a 
learning platform for both administration and development. A modest 
machine will easily support apache and mod_python.
