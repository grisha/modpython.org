Actually, no!

Had the same problem a few weeks, with a new python, apache and mod_python.
Making a script.pyc solved it, haven`t look into it yet.

I have heard of others beside me having the same problem (all using Debian), 
so I thought this problem was very common. At least I believed that an 
'official' patch was available.

I will live with my own patch - which I don't consider permanent - until 
things solve themselves with a new release or combination of 
Apache/Python/mod_python.

If anybody finds a better patch or solution I'll be happy hearing about it.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: [mod_python] Problems re-using a child's python interpreter
Message-ID: <200110032219.f93MJGD21539@eden.ispol.com>

mod_python: Version 2.7.6
apache: 1.3.14

Hi folks,

I wrote a sort of minimal 'content management helper', that translates
XML to html and inserts dynamically created content on the
fly. Nothing fancy, but it works - thought I, untill I found out it
dosn't.

My python handler looks like this:

from mod_python import apache
import logic.util

def handler(req):
    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()    

    rendering = logic.util.getRendering(req.filename, req)
    rendering = logic.util.insertDynamicContent(req, rendering)
    req.write(rendering)
    
    return apache.OK

The directory it's supposed to work in is:

<Directory /var/public_html/ted-magoo.de/domains/some-domain.de/www>
  AddHandler python-program .xml
  PythonHandler roteerde
  PythonDebug On
  DirectoryIndex index.xml
  PythonInterpPerDirectory On
</Directory>

There is a 'logic' dir below the 'www' directory that contains a
__init__.py and a util.py to make the import above work. And so it
does until I created a second domain with the same setup and (nearly)
the same files. I can access both directories at a time, but as soon I
access one and than the other I get an apache error like:

make_obcallback(): could not import mod_python.apache.
make_obcallback(): could not call init.
[Wed Oct  3 15:42:38 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] python_handler:
make_obcallback returned no obCallBack]

I figured out that this has something to do with python being unable
to find some modules. So I set a very long PYTHONPATH width all module
paths on it before starting apache. Now I get all sorts of unrelated
module-not-found errors. However, this only happens sometimes! Every
second request or so gives me an error message or an error 500.

My attempts debugging seem to indicate that errors do not occur when
apache created a new sub-process and with it a new python interpreter
to answer the request. So the only solution I came up with is setting

MaxRequestsPerChild 1

in http.conf. This lets apache sub-processes die as soon they answered
a request. Of course it creates an enormous overhead.

I'd greatly appreciate any ideas you have to solve the problem. I am
sure you are facing similar problems when creating complex web
applications with mod_python. What design patterns do you use to do
so?

Regards
Diedrich

Doubtful. By default mod_python creaes a new sub-interpreter per
virtual server. Since I'm using my computer at home right now to try
things out that would always (for both projects) be 'localhost'. Using
this directive causes mod_python to create a new interpreter for each
directory (project) so I can use the same identifyers without name-clashes.

I tried it that way, too. Also using

   PythonInterpPerDirective On

had have no effect.

Using none of the obove causes one of web-sites to appear in the
layout of the other, because the 'look' depends on a page.py in each
project's directory.

Diedrich

Uhh... I see I didn't have to explain how mod_python works to
*you*... :-)

Subject: [mod_python] About authentication
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10110041113020.7933-100000@mrham.hamslab.com>

I'm trying to implement custom authentication using authenhandler.
I want to save user info and password in encrypted file that other users
can only read. So I've tried to use md5.new('password').hexdigest().
'password' is a variable that stores password using 
req.get_basic_auth_pw().

When I've tried to load restricted page, I got error saying 'password'
variable is not read-only buffer, but None. I can use direct comparison
of username and password with string as to the mod_python document, but I
can't use it in a function that accepts string as a argument.

Any comment or help would be appreciated.
mod_python is 2.7.2.

If you look in the src/Makefile.in you'll see something about _eprintf.o,
this looks to be the same kind of problem. I am not sure what causes this
exactly, but for some reason gcc on solaris has this behaviour of not
including certain files.

Try this:

(in mod_python directory)

$ cd src
$ ar -x `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name` _eprintf.o
(this should create an _muldi3.o file)

In src/Makefile, somewhere below "OBJS=" add _multi3.0 after _eprintf.o

$ rm mod_python.so
$ make mod_python.so

HTH,

Grisha

Hello All,
	I am using Apache 1.13.20, Python 2.1.1 and modpython 2.7.6 on Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.
	I am also using the publisher handler to publish my pages.
	This all work very well and is nice and speedy.
	However, when I try and add a CleanupHandler I get the following in my logs:
	
	[notice] child pid 1787 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
	
	Apache does not crash. Only the child thread does.
	
	Without the CleanupHandler everything is fine.
	
	The relevant apache conf:
	
	# httpd.conf
	<Directory /var/www/site-foobar/wwwroot/mod-python>
		SetHandler python-program
		PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
		PythonCleanupHandler cleanup
		PythonDebug On
	</Directory>

	My cleanup handler looks like this (for debugging I've taken everything out.) :
	# cleanup.py
	
	def cleanuphandler(req):
		return apache.OK
	
	Has anybody else had this problem or can anybody suggest a fix?

	Thanks,
		Chaitan
	
	PS. The following may also be relevant.
	1) Python is compiled without threads.
	2) I have tried sticking -DEAPI in the Makefile.
	3) I have also not stuck -DEAPI in the modpython Makefile. 
	I don't know which is correct but the former stopped apache from complaining on startup.

Subject: [mod_python] Reload problem - again!
Message-ID: <200110152159.f9FLx4N09351@usr00.cybercity.dk>

Hi,

I still have a reload problem when using mod_python. From the error_log below 
it can be seen (last line) that apache searches for a file called 'myfile.p'. 
What happend to the last 'y' in '.py' ?

I'm still using my homemade workaround, but I'm not sure this is the right 
way to do it. I'm using python 2.2.1 and I have just installed mod_python 
2.7.6 and apache 1.3.20, but the reload problem is still there. Is this 
really only a problem on my system?

My homemade workaround in apache.py (line 356,359) is as follows:

            # check also .py and take the newest
            ## if os.path.exists(filepath[:-1]) :
            if os.path.exists(filepath[:]):

                # get the time of the .py file
                ## mod = os.stat(filepath[:-1])
                mod = os.stat(filepath[:])
                mtime = max(mtime, mod[stat.ST_MTIME])


In filepath[:-1] I have just removed '-1'. Well, it works for me at the 
moment, but I'm afraid that someday nothing will work because of this 
modification. Could there be something else wrong with my configuration? If 
anybody have an idea I'm happy to hear about it.

Thanks in advance!

The problem isn't with the "[:-1]", it's that os.path.exists() *raises* an
error. It's not supposed to raise errors, just return true or false (at
least according to documentation):

http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-os.path.html

This is a Python bug that begins in 2.1 and is still in 2.2a1, but seems
to be fixed in 2.2a4.

This is also in the mod_python FAQ, and there is a link there to a patch
;-)

THANK YOU :-))
Now everything seems to work just fine :-)
I installed python 2.2a4 and recompiled everything. Now it just runs smoothly 
(at least my simple example). But now I'm eager to put on more python etc. 
Additionally I had to upgrade to MySQL-python0.9.1c2 to get my database interface to work again.

Thank you again!

Message-ID: <3BCCC460.91C7DD19@myriad.com>

Is it possible to set multiple cookies through the Request object?

Request req

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "first=value1"
This works to set the first cookie

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "second=value2"
The second cookie will overwrite the  first in the req.headers_out list
before calling
req.send_http_headers()

yes, use req.headers_out.add()

Apache cannot start after installing mod-python under Windows NT.

Windows: NT 4.0 SP6a
Apache: 1.3.22
Python: 2.1.1
mod_python: 
	mod_python.dll from python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip, 
	python\lib\mod_python from mod_python-2.7.4.tgz

Error:
Could not start the Apache on \\machinename
Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

I think I did what was described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html
With one exception, here is no mod_python-x\lib\mod_python directory instead
I got mod_python-x\lib\python\mod_python. I assumed that simply mod_python
should be in \python\lib.

Your apache is 1.3.22 and the dll is for 1.3.20. Maybe that is the problem?

That is how it should be read. \python\lib\mod_python should contain the
files with no subdirectories in it.

I am trying to check different things. When I tried manually compile
apache.py in \lib\mod_python dirctory I got this error:

C:\Dev\Python\Lib\mod_python>python apache.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "apache.py", line 55, in ?
    import _apache
ImportError: No module named _apache

I got no _apache.py:

              11 File(s)         92,498 bytes

I guess this error occures too when tries to execute 'PythonHandler mptest'
and mptest.py fails to import apache.py module.

Your apache is 1.3.22 and the dll is for 1.3.20. Maybe that is the problem?

That is how it should be read. \python\lib\mod_python should contain the

Right place is Apache modules directory, isn't it? Latest (or maybe I am
wrong???) precompiled version I found there is python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip
which ig got from http://www.modpython.org/dist/win/2.7.4/

You need to make sure you have the most up to date mod_python.dll file in 
the right place as well. Ensure you have the most up to date files from 
www.modpython.org

It looks like my httpd.conf was wrong. I was following description from
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html but
I didn't read comments in section AddModule of my httpd.conf: [WHENEVER YOU
CHANGE THE LOADMODULE SECTION ABOVE, UPDATE THIS TOO!]

When I added 'AddModule mod_python.c' Apache can be restarted and mptest.py
works.

I think would be nice to mention this in Windows Installation document, just
in case.

Thanks for all comments and hints,

Mariusz

Hi,
  I am new to mod_python and would like to get to know
more about it. I downloaded the source and install it
as dynamically linked module. Everything works fine. I
also get the example mptest working. However, a glitch
i encountered was the warning message when i restart
my apache. I am using RH7.1 and apache 1.3.19. WHen i
restart apache, i get this warning message:
-------------------------------------------
Stopping httpd: [OK ]
Starting httpd: [Thu Oct 25 09:43:31 2001] [warn]
Loaded DSO /usr/lib/apache/mod_python.so uses plain
Apache 1.3 API, this module might crash under EAPI!
(please recompile it with -DEAPI)
-------------------------------------
What does this really mean? 

Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <000a01c15e29$4a360990$05b450d9@apache>

Hy,

I'm completely new to mod_python (and not that good in english-speaking
;) ).
I tried to install it on my Apache 1.3.22 (Win32).
I installed Python 2.1.1, mod_python (exactly!) as described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html - I
also added
the "AddModule mod_python.c" line to my httpd.conf - everything fine so far,
Apache starts without displaying error-messages.
But: Everytime I try to execute the python-example, it displays:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
Mod_python error: "PythonHandler mptest"

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 181, in Dispatch
    module = import_module(module_name, _req)

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 335, in import_module
    f, p, d = imp.find_module(parts[i], path)

ImportError: No module named mptest


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------

Since I didn't find any mptest-module in the mod_python-2.7.6-release, I'm
just wondering - did I forget something??
There's an apache-compiled and none-compiled .py in the mod_python folder.

Regards

Stefan

Уважаемые господа!

    Что такое Информация ? 
Информация - это власть, богатство, успех, процветание.
Кто владеет информацией, тот управляет.

     Информация, которую предоставляет наша компания будет полезна, а в отдельных случаях и просто необходима, как организациям, предприятиям, так и каждому человеку и его семье.
    1. Все мы знаем слова <горный воздух>, но наверное не все знают, что его целебные свойства зависят не только от отсутствия вредных примесей, но и от наличия так называемых <отрицательных ионов> или аэроионов(АИ) кислорода.
      Деятельность "цивилизованного человечества", развитие производств с появлением гигантских "смогов" привели к резкому уменьшению количества <отрицательных ионов> в воздухе. Воздух наших жилых помещений биологически мертвый. Для сравнения: в горах Абхазии (где больше всего долгожителей) количество отрицательных аэроионов около 20 000 в 1 куб. см воздуха, в морском воздухе их 2 000, в зеленом же массиве средней полосы России - 200-1000, в производственных помещениях всего 10-20, а перед экраном телевизора или компьютера - абсолютный 0. 
      По санитарным нормам МЗ СССР уровень концентрации аэроионов, отклонение от которого создает угрозу здоровью человека - находится в диапазоне от 600 АИ до 50000 АИ в куб.см.!!!!!
         Все это приводит к болезням, ослаблению имунитета, сокращению жизни.
        Внешние факторы защиты уже не помогают. Требуется вмешательство искусственным путем. И здесь важную роль могут сыграть искусственные генераторы отрицательных аэроионов - аэроионизаторы или как их еще называют - "Люстры Чижевского". Они создают достаточную для жизненных процессов концентрацию отрицательных аэроионов, порядка 20 000 - 30 000 в 1 куб.см, имитируя условия горной местности или Черноморского побережья Крыма или Кавказа. В этих условиях человек испытывает комфортное состояние, приобретает здоровье и продляет себе жизнь.
       Наша организация продаёт данные люстры (четыре модели) собранные непосредственно по чертежам самого А.Л. Чижевского оптом и в розницу.
      О здоровье необходимо заботиться сейчас, не откладывая на потом. Ведь, как известно здоровье не купишь.

        Вся информация о товарах нашей компании на сайте: www.viel.f2s.com 

     2. Мы предлагаем надежную замену электрическим чайникам -аппараты для нагрева и охлаждения питьевой воды( кулеры), а также аппараты газводы для <горячих> цехов и предприятий(АВ-2,АВ-3,POST-MIX и др).
    Кулеры-очень удобны при использовании в офисах , где они бесперебойно обеспечивают холодной водой или горячими напитками. 
    Они совмещают функции чайника и охладителя, позволяющие мгновенно воспользоваться горячей или холодной питьевой водой. Это значительно облегчает приготовление чая, кофе, растворимых супов, а также охлажденных напитков.
Начав пользоваться нашими аппаратами в быту и на работе, вы не вернетесь к пользованию чайником и водой из под крана. 
     Настольные модели идеально подходят для домашнего использования. Они не занимают много места и прекрасно вписываются в интерьер современной кухни. Снижается расход электроэнергии - нагрев воду, кулер автоматически переключается в режим ожидания и включит нагрев снова, когда температура воды в термосе опустится до 85°С..

        3. Область электроники, это не только поставки приборов, аппаратуры, но и различные комплектующие как отечественных, так и зарубежных производителей электронной техники. Это такие фирмы как International Rectifier, Epcos,Bourns, Metex, unit-t и др.
        4. Сварочные электроды: мы продаём электроды от ведущих отечественных производителей. Все сварочные электроды соответствуют ГОСТу и имеют сертификат качества. Также мы предлагаем Х/К и Г/К листовой металлопркат.
В настоящее время мы предлагаем уникальную разработку отечественных ученых: компенсирующие патрубки для безсварного соединения металлических труб!!!(D от 25 до 1000мм.)
          Наши менеджеры имеют богатый опыт продаж, маркетинговых исследований, ведения переговоров с крупными поставщиками и потребителями товаров, что позволяет нам достать нужную Вам продукцию по выгодным для Вас ценам и в оптимально короткие сроки.
         Рассмотрим интересные предложения(по приемлемым, конкурирующим ценам)сбыта продукции Вашего предприятия, а также возможен вариант рассмотрения поставки товаров, которые не вошли в сферу деятельности нашей организации!!!     
         Вашу потребность, можно отправить на наш факс:(095) 275-89-94, или по электронной почте: vielmm@yahoo.com 

         Мы ждем Вас и выражаем уверенность в том, что обратившись к нам, Вы получите квалифицированную помощь, внимательное отношение к Вашим потребностям, оперативную обработку Вашего заказа.

Hi All,

I compiled mod_python 2.7.6 in Linux RedHat 7.0. Trying to start Apache I
get:

[root@spongebob bin]# ./apachectl start
Syntax error on line 235 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_python.so into server: undefined

./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

I'm lost. Any direction/hint VERY welcomed!

PS: To compile, I used:

[root@spongebob /root]# /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -I include -I
/usr/include/python1.5 -c mod_python.c
/usr/lib/python1.5/config/libpython1.5.a -lpthread

Grisha,

Thanks for your answer.

I compiled Apache for DSO support. Will ./configure and make do?

Thanks again,

Grisha,

The problem was I was specifying the apxs directory instead of the
executable (full path+name) in ./configure.

Thanks.

Actually, no!

Had the same problem a few weeks, with a new python, apache and mod_python.
Making a script.pyc solved it, haven`t look into it yet.

I have heard of others beside me having the same problem (all using Debian), 
so I thought this problem was very common. At least I believed that an 
'official' patch was available.

I will live with my own patch - which I don't consider permanent - until 
things solve themselves with a new release or combination of 
Apache/Python/mod_python.

If anybody finds a better patch or solution I'll be happy hearing about it.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: [mod_python] Problems re-using a child's python interpreter
Message-ID: <200110032219.f93MJGD21539@eden.ispol.com>

mod_python: Version 2.7.6
apache: 1.3.14

Hi folks,

I wrote a sort of minimal 'content management helper', that translates
XML to html and inserts dynamically created content on the
fly. Nothing fancy, but it works - thought I, untill I found out it
dosn't.

My python handler looks like this:

from mod_python import apache
import logic.util

def handler(req):
    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()    

    rendering = logic.util.getRendering(req.filename, req)
    rendering = logic.util.insertDynamicContent(req, rendering)
    req.write(rendering)
    
    return apache.OK

The directory it's supposed to work in is:

<Directory /var/public_html/ted-magoo.de/domains/some-domain.de/www>
  AddHandler python-program .xml
  PythonHandler roteerde
  PythonDebug On
  DirectoryIndex index.xml
  PythonInterpPerDirectory On
</Directory>

There is a 'logic' dir below the 'www' directory that contains a
__init__.py and a util.py to make the import above work. And so it
does until I created a second domain with the same setup and (nearly)
the same files. I can access both directories at a time, but as soon I
access one and than the other I get an apache error like:

make_obcallback(): could not import mod_python.apache.
make_obcallback(): could not call init.
[Wed Oct  3 15:42:38 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] python_handler:
make_obcallback returned no obCallBack]

I figured out that this has something to do with python being unable
to find some modules. So I set a very long PYTHONPATH width all module
paths on it before starting apache. Now I get all sorts of unrelated
module-not-found errors. However, this only happens sometimes! Every
second request or so gives me an error message or an error 500.

My attempts debugging seem to indicate that errors do not occur when
apache created a new sub-process and with it a new python interpreter
to answer the request. So the only solution I came up with is setting

MaxRequestsPerChild 1

in http.conf. This lets apache sub-processes die as soon they answered
a request. Of course it creates an enormous overhead.

I'd greatly appreciate any ideas you have to solve the problem. I am
sure you are facing similar problems when creating complex web
applications with mod_python. What design patterns do you use to do
so?

Regards
Diedrich

Doubtful. By default mod_python creaes a new sub-interpreter per
virtual server. Since I'm using my computer at home right now to try
things out that would always (for both projects) be 'localhost'. Using
this directive causes mod_python to create a new interpreter for each
directory (project) so I can use the same identifyers without name-clashes.

I tried it that way, too. Also using

   PythonInterpPerDirective On

had have no effect.

Using none of the obove causes one of web-sites to appear in the
layout of the other, because the 'look' depends on a page.py in each
project's directory.

Diedrich

Uhh... I see I didn't have to explain how mod_python works to

Subject: [mod_python] About authentication
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10110041113020.7933-100000@mrham.hamslab.com>

I'm trying to implement custom authentication using authenhandler.
I want to save user info and password in encrypted file that other users
can only read. So I've tried to use md5.new('password').hexdigest().
'password' is a variable that stores password using 
req.get_basic_auth_pw().

When I've tried to load restricted page, I got error saying 'password'
variable is not read-only buffer, but None. I can use direct comparison
of username and password with string as to the mod_python document, but I
can't use it in a function that accepts string as a argument.

Any comment or help would be appreciated.
mod_python is 2.7.2.

If you look in the src/Makefile.in you'll see something about _eprintf.o,
this looks to be the same kind of problem. I am not sure what causes this
exactly, but for some reason gcc on solaris has this behaviour of not
including certain files.

Try this:

(in mod_python directory)

$ cd src
$ ar -x `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name` _eprintf.o
(this should create an _muldi3.o file)

In src/Makefile, somewhere below "OBJS=" add _multi3.0 after _eprintf.o

$ rm mod_python.so
$ make mod_python.so

HTH,

Grisha

Hello All,
	I am using Apache 1.13.20, Python 2.1.1 and modpython 2.7.6 on Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.
	I am also using the publisher handler to publish my pages.
	This all work very well and is nice and speedy.
	However, when I try and add a CleanupHandler I get the following in my logs:
	
	[notice] child pid 1787 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
	
	Apache does not crash. Only the child thread does.
	
	Without the CleanupHandler everything is fine.
	
	The relevant apache conf:
	
	# httpd.conf
	<Directory /var/www/site-foobar/wwwroot/mod-python>
		SetHandler python-program
		PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
		PythonCleanupHandler cleanup
		PythonDebug On
	</Directory>

	My cleanup handler looks like this (for debugging I've taken everything out.) :
	# cleanup.py
	
	def cleanuphandler(req):
		return apache.OK
	
	Has anybody else had this problem or can anybody suggest a fix?

	Thanks,
		Chaitan
	
	PS. The following may also be relevant.
	1) Python is compiled without threads.
	2) I have tried sticking -DEAPI in the Makefile.
	3) I have also not stuck -DEAPI in the modpython Makefile. 
	I don't know which is correct but the former stopped apache from complaining on startup.

	This all work very well and is nice and speedy.
	However, when I try and add a CleanupHandler I get the following in my logs:
	
	[notice] child pid 1787 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
	
	Apache does not crash. Only the child thread does.
	
	Without the CleanupHandler everything is fine.
	
	The relevant apache conf:
	
	# httpd.conf
	<Directory /var/www/site-foobar/wwwroot/mod-python>
		SetHandler python-program
		PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
		PythonCleanupHandler cleanup
		PythonDebug On
	</Directory>

	My cleanup handler looks like this (for debugging I've taken everything out.) :
	# cleanup.py
	
	def cleanuphandler(req):
		return apache.OK
	
	Has anybody else had this problem or can anybody suggest a fix?

	Thanks,
		Chaitan
	
	PS. The following may also be relevant.
	1) Python is compiled without threads.
	2) I have tried sticking -DEAPI in the Makefile.
	3) I have also not stuck -DEAPI in the modpython Makefile. 
	I don't know which is correct but the former stopped apache from complaining on startup.

Subject: [mod_python] Reload problem - again!
Message-ID: <200110152159.f9FLx4N09351@usr00.cybercity.dk>

Hi,

I still have a reload problem when using mod_python. From the error_log below 
it can be seen (last line) that apache searches for a file called 'myfile.p'. 
What happend to the last 'y' in '.py' ?

I'm still using my homemade workaround, but I'm not sure this is the right 
way to do it. I'm using python 2.2.1 and I have just installed mod_python 
2.7.6 and apache 1.3.20, but the reload problem is still there. Is this 
really only a problem on my system?

My homemade workaround in apache.py (line 356,359) is as follows:

            # check also .py and take the newest
            ## if os.path.exists(filepath[:-1]) :
            if os.path.exists(filepath[:]):

                # get the time of the .py file
                ## mod = os.stat(filepath[:-1])
                mod = os.stat(filepath[:])
                mtime = max(mtime, mod[stat.ST_MTIME])


In filepath[:-1] I have just removed '-1'. Well, it works for me at the 
moment, but I'm afraid that someday nothing will work because of this 
modification. Could there be something else wrong with my configuration? If 
anybody have an idea I'm happy to hear about it.

Thanks in advance!
Br.

The problem isn't with the "[:-1]", it's that os.path.exists() *raises* an
error. It's not supposed to raise errors, just return true or false (at
least according to documentation):

http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-os.path.html

This is a Python bug that begins in 2.1 and is still in 2.2a1, but seems
to be fixed in 2.2a4.

This is also in the mod_python FAQ, and there is a link there to a patch
;-)

THANK YOU :-))
Now everything seems to work just fine :-)
I installed python 2.2a4 and recompiled everything. Now it just runs smoothly 
(at least my simple example). But now I'm eager to put on more python etc. 
Additionally I had to upgrade to MySQL-python0.9.1c2 to get my database interface to work again.

Thank you again!

Message-ID: <3BCCC460.91C7DD19@myriad.com>

Is it possible to set multiple cookies through the Request object?

Request req

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "first=value1"
This works to set the first cookie

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "second=value2"
The second cookie will overwrite the  first in the req.headers_out list
before calling
req.send_http_headers()

yes, use req.headers_out.add()

Apache cannot start after installing mod-python under Windows NT.

Windows: NT 4.0 SP6a
Apache: 1.3.22
Python: 2.1.1
mod_python: 
	mod_python.dll from python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip,

Error:
Could not start the Apache on \\machinename

I think I did what was described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html

Your apache is 1.3.22 and the dll is for 1.3.20. Maybe that is the problem?

That is how it should be read. \python\lib\mod_python should contain the
files with no subdirectories in it.

I am trying to check different things. When I tried manually compile
apache.py in \lib\mod_python dirctory I got this error:

C:\Dev\Python\Lib\mod_python>python apache.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "apache.py", line 55, in ?

I got no _apache.py:

I guess this error occures too when tries to execute 'PythonHandler mptest'
and mptest.py fails to import apache.py module.

Right place is Apache modules directory, isn't it? Latest (or maybe I am
wrong???) precompiled version I found there is python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip
which ig got from http://www.modpython.org/dist/win/2.7.4/

You need to make sure you have the most up to date mod_python.dll file in 
the right place as well. Ensure you have the most up to date files from 
www.modpython.org

It looks like my httpd.conf was wrong. I was following description from
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html but
I didn't read comments in section AddModule of my httpd.conf: [WHENEVER YOU
CHANGE THE LOADMODULE SECTION ABOVE, UPDATE THIS TOO!]

When I added 'AddModule mod_python.c' Apache can be restarted and mptest.py
works.

I think would be nice to mention this in Windows Installation document, just
in case.

Thanks for all comments and hints,

Mariusz

Hi,
  I am new to mod_python and would like to get to know
more about it. I downloaded the source and install it
as dynamically linked module. Everything works fine. I
also get the example mptest working. However, a glitch
i encountered was the warning message when i restart
my apache. I am using RH7.1 and apache 1.3.19. WHen i
restart apache, i get this warning message:
-------------------------------------------
Stopping httpd: [OK ]
Starting httpd: [Thu Oct 25 09:43:31 2001] [warn]
Loaded DSO /usr/lib/apache/mod_python.so uses plain
Apache 1.3 API, this module might crash under EAPI!
(please recompile it with -DEAPI)
-------------------------------------
What does this really mean? 

Thanks a lot.

Subject: [mod_python] win32 problem
Message-ID: <000a01c15e29$4a360990$05b450d9@apache>

Hy,

I'm completely new to mod_python (and not that good in english-speaking
;) ).
I tried to install it on my Apache 1.3.22 (Win32).
I installed Python 2.1.1, mod_python (exactly!) as described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html - I
also added
the "AddModule mod_python.c" line to my httpd.conf - everything fine so far,
Apache starts without displaying error-messages.
But: Everytime I try to execute the python-example, it displays:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
Mod_python error: "PythonHandler mptest"

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 181, in Dispatch
    module = import_module(module_name, _req)

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 335, in import_module
    f, p, d = imp.find_module(parts[i], path)

ImportError: No module named mptest


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------

Since I didn't find any mptest-module in the mod_python-2.7.6-release, I'm
just wondering - did I forget something??
There's an apache-compiled and none-compiled .py in the mod_python folder.

Regards

Stefan

Уважаемые господа!

    Что такое Информация ? 
Информация - это власть, богатство, успех, процветание.
Кто владеет информацией, тот управляет.

     Информация, которую предоставляет наша компания будет полезна, а в отдельных случаях и просто необходима, как организациям, предприятиям, так и каждому человеку и его семье.
    1. Все мы знаем слова <горный воздух>, но наверное не все знают, что его целебные свойства зависят не только от отсутствия вредных примесей, но и от наличия так называемых <отрицательных ионов> или аэроионов(АИ) кислорода.
      Деятельность "цивилизованного человечества", развитие производств с появлением гигантских "смогов" привели к резкому уменьшению количества <отрицательных ионов> в воздухе. Воздух наших жилых помещений биологически мертвый. Для сравнения: в горах Абхазии (где больше всего долгожителей) количество отрицательных аэроионов около 20 000 в 1 куб. см воздуха, в морском воздухе их 2 000, в зеленом же массиве средней полосы России - 200-1000, в производственных помещениях всего 10-20, а перед экраном телевизора или компьютера - абсолютный 0. 
      По санитарным нормам МЗ СССР уровень концентрации аэроионов, отклонение от которого создает угрозу здоровью человека - находится в диапазоне от 600 АИ до 50000 АИ в куб.см.!!!!!
         Все это приводит к болезням, ослаблению имунитета, сокращению жизни.
        Внешние факторы защиты уже не помогают. Требуется вмешательство искусственным путем. И здесь важную роль могут сыграть искусственные генераторы отрицательных аэроионов - аэроионизаторы или как их еще называют - "Люстры Чижевского". Они создают достаточную для жизненных процессов концентрацию отрицательных аэроионов, порядка 20 000 - 30 000 в 1 куб.см, имитируя условия горной местности или Черноморского побережья Крыма или Кавказа. В этих условиях человек испытывает комфортное состояние, приобретает здоровье и продляет себе жизнь.
       Наша организация продаёт данные люстры (четыре модели) собранные непосредственно по чертежам самого А.Л. Чижевского оптом и в розницу.
      О здоровье необходимо заботиться сейчас, не откладывая на потом. Ведь, как известно здоровье не купишь.

        Вся информация о товарах нашей компании на сайте: www.viel.f2s.com 

     2. Мы предлагаем надежную замену электрическим чайникам -аппараты для нагрева и охлаждения питьевой воды( кулеры), а также аппараты газводы для <горячих> цехов и предприятий(АВ-2,АВ-3,POST-MIX и др).
    Кулеры-очень удобны при использовании в офисах , где они бесперебойно обеспечивают холодной водой или горячими напитками. 
    Они совмещают функции чайника и охладителя, позволяющие мгновенно воспользоваться горячей или холодной питьевой водой. Это значительно облегчает приготовление чая, кофе, растворимых супов, а также охлажденных напитков.
Начав пользоваться нашими аппаратами в быту и на работе, вы не вернетесь к пользованию чайником и водой из под крана. 
     Настольные модели идеально подходят для домашнего использования. Они не занимают много места и прекрасно вписываются в интерьер современной кухни. Снижается расход электроэнергии - нагрев воду, кулер автоматически переключается в режим ожидания и включит нагрев снова, когда температура воды в термосе опустится до 85°С..

        3. Область электроники, это не только поставки приборов, аппаратуры, но и различные комплектующие как отечественных, так и зарубежных производителей электронной техники. Это такие фирмы как International Rectifier, Epcos,Bourns, Metex, unit-t и др.
        4. Сварочные электроды: мы продаём электроды от ведущих отечественных производителей. Все сварочные электроды соответствуют ГОСТу и имеют сертификат качества. Также мы предлагаем Х/К и Г/К листовой металлопркат.
В настоящее время мы предлагаем уникальную разработку отечественных ученых: компенсирующие патрубки для безсварного соединения металлических труб!!!(D от 25 до 1000мм.)
          Наши менеджеры имеют богатый опыт продаж, маркетинговых исследований, ведения переговоров с крупными поставщиками и потребителями товаров, что позволяет нам достать нужную Вам продукцию по выгодным для Вас ценам и в оптимально короткие сроки.
         Рассмотрим интересные предложения(по приемлемым, конкурирующим ценам)сбыта продукции Вашего предприятия, а также возможен вариант рассмотрения поставки товаров, которые не вошли в сферу деятельности нашей организации!!!

Hi All,

I compiled mod_python 2.7.6 in Linux RedHat 7.0. Trying to start Apache I
get:

./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

I'm lost. Any direction/hint VERY welcomed!

PS: To compile, I used:

[root@spongebob /root]# /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -I include -I
/usr/include/python1.5 -c mod_python.c
/usr/lib/python1.5/config/libpython1.5.a -lpthread

Grisha,

Thanks for your answer.

I compiled Apache for DSO support. Will ./configure and make do?

Thanks again,

Grisha,

The problem was I was specifying the apxs directory instead of the
executable (full path+name) in ./configure.

Thanks.

Actually, no!

Had the same problem a few weeks, with a new python, apache and mod_python.
Making a script.pyc solved it, haven`t look into it yet.

I have heard of others beside me having the same problem (all using Debian), 
so I thought this problem was very common. At least I believed that an 
'official' patch was available.

I will live with my own patch - which I don't consider permanent - until 
things solve themselves with a new release or combination of 
Apache/Python/mod_python.

If anybody finds a better patch or solution I'll be happy hearing about it.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: [mod_python] Problems re-using a child's python interpreter
Message-ID: <200110032219.f93MJGD21539@eden.ispol.com>

mod_python: Version 2.7.6
apache: 1.3.14

Hi folks,

I wrote a sort of minimal 'content management helper', that translates
XML to html and inserts dynamically created content on the
fly. Nothing fancy, but it works - thought I, untill I found out it
dosn't.

My python handler looks like this:

from mod_python import apache
import logic.util

def handler(req):
    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()    

    rendering = logic.util.getRendering(req.filename, req)
    rendering = logic.util.insertDynamicContent(req, rendering)
    req.write(rendering)
    
    return apache.OK

The directory it's supposed to work in is:

<Directory /var/public_html/ted-magoo.de/domains/some-domain.de/www>
  AddHandler python-program .xml
  PythonHandler roteerde
  PythonDebug On
  DirectoryIndex index.xml
  PythonInterpPerDirectory On
</Directory>

There is a 'logic' dir below the 'www' directory that contains a
__init__.py and a util.py to make the import above work. And so it
does until I created a second domain with the same setup and (nearly)
the same files. I can access both directories at a time, but as soon I
access one and than the other I get an apache error like:

make_obcallback(): could not import mod_python.apache.
make_obcallback(): could not call init.
[Wed Oct  3 15:42:38 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] python_handler:
make_obcallback returned no obCallBack]

I figured out that this has something to do with python being unable
to find some modules. So I set a very long PYTHONPATH width all module
paths on it before starting apache. Now I get all sorts of unrelated
module-not-found errors. However, this only happens sometimes! Every
second request or so gives me an error message or an error 500.

My attempts debugging seem to indicate that errors do not occur when
apache created a new sub-process and with it a new python interpreter
to answer the request. So the only solution I came up with is setting

MaxRequestsPerChild 1

in http.conf. This lets apache sub-processes die as soon they answered
a request. Of course it creates an enormous overhead.

I'd greatly appreciate any ideas you have to solve the problem. I am
sure you are facing similar problems when creating complex web
applications with mod_python. What design patterns do you use to do
so?

Regards
Diedrich

Doubtful. By default mod_python creaes a new sub-interpreter per
virtual server. Since I'm using my computer at home right now to try
things out that would always (for both projects) be 'localhost'. Using
this directive causes mod_python to create a new interpreter for each
directory (project) so I can use the same identifyers without name-clashes.

I tried it that way, too. Also using

   PythonInterpPerDirective On

had have no effect.

Using none of the obove causes one of web-sites to appear in the
layout of the other, because the 'look' depends on a page.py in each
project's directory.

Diedrich

Uhh... I see I didn't have to explain how mod_python works to

Subject: [mod_python] About authentication
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10110041113020.7933-100000@mrham.hamslab.com>

I'm trying to implement custom authentication using authenhandler.
I want to save user info and password in encrypted file that other users
can only read. So I've tried to use md5.new('password').hexdigest().
'password' is a variable that stores password using 
req.get_basic_auth_pw().

When I've tried to load restricted page, I got error saying 'password'
variable is not read-only buffer, but None. I can use direct comparison
of username and password with string as to the mod_python document, but I
can't use it in a function that accepts string as a argument.

Any comment or help would be appreciated.
mod_python is 2.7.2.

If you look in the src/Makefile.in you'll see something about _eprintf.o,
this looks to be the same kind of problem. I am not sure what causes this
exactly, but for some reason gcc on solaris has this behaviour of not
including certain files.

Try this:

(in mod_python directory)

$ cd src
$ ar -x `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name` _eprintf.o
(this should create an _muldi3.o file)

In src/Makefile, somewhere below "OBJS=" add _multi3.0 after _eprintf.o

$ rm mod_python.so
$ make mod_python.so

HTH,

Grisha

Hello All,
	I am using Apache 1.13.20, Python 2.1.1 and modpython 2.7.6 on Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.
	I am also using the publisher handler to publish my pages.
	This all work very well and is nice and speedy.
	However, when I try and add a CleanupHandler I get the following in my logs:
	
	[notice] child pid 1787 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
	
	Apache does not crash. Only the child thread does.
	
	Without the CleanupHandler everything is fine.
	
	The relevant apache conf:
	
	# httpd.conf
	<Directory /var/www/site-foobar/wwwroot/mod-python>
		SetHandler python-program
		PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
		PythonCleanupHandler cleanup
		PythonDebug On
	</Directory>

	My cleanup handler looks like this (for debugging I've taken everything out.) :
	# cleanup.py
	
	def cleanuphandler(req):
		return apache.OK
	
	Has anybody else had this problem or can anybody suggest a fix?

	Thanks,
		Chaitan
	
	PS. The following may also be relevant.
	1) Python is compiled without threads.
	2) I have tried sticking -DEAPI in the Makefile.
	3) I have also not stuck -DEAPI in the modpython Makefile. 
	I don't know which is correct but the former stopped apache from complaining on startup.

Subject: [mod_python] Reload problem - again!
Message-ID: <200110152159.f9FLx4N09351@usr00.cybercity.dk>

Hi,

I still have a reload problem when using mod_python. From the error_log below 
it can be seen (last line) that apache searches for a file called 'myfile.p'. 
What happend to the last 'y' in '.py' ?

I'm still using my homemade workaround, but I'm not sure this is the right 
way to do it. I'm using python 2.2.1 and I have just installed mod_python 
2.7.6 and apache 1.3.20, but the reload problem is still there. Is this 
really only a problem on my system?

My homemade workaround in apache.py (line 356,359) is as follows:

            # check also .py and take the newest
            ## if os.path.exists(filepath[:-1]) :
            if os.path.exists(filepath[:]):

                # get the time of the .py file
                ## mod = os.stat(filepath[:-1])
                mod = os.stat(filepath[:])
                mtime = max(mtime, mod[stat.ST_MTIME])


In filepath[:-1] I have just removed '-1'. Well, it works for me at the 
moment, but I'm afraid that someday nothing will work because of this 
modification. Could there be something else wrong with my configuration? If 
anybody have an idea I'm happy to hear about it.

Thanks in advance!
Br.

The problem isn't with the "[:-1]", it's that os.path.exists() *raises* an
error. It's not supposed to raise errors, just return true or false (at
least according to documentation):

http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-os.path.html

This is a Python bug that begins in 2.1 and is still in 2.2a1, but seems
to be fixed in 2.2a4.

This is also in the mod_python FAQ, and there is a link there to a patch
;-)

THANK YOU :-))
Now everything seems to work just fine :-)
I installed python 2.2a4 and recompiled everything. Now it just runs smoothly 
(at least my simple example). But now I'm eager to put on more python etc. 
Additionally I had to upgrade to MySQL-python0.9.1c2 to get my database interface to work again.

Thank you again!
Br,

Message-ID: <3BCCC460.91C7DD19@myriad.com>

Is it possible to set multiple cookies through the Request object?

Request req

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "first=value1"
This works to set the first cookie

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "second=value2"
The second cookie will overwrite the  first in the req.headers_out list
before calling
req.send_http_headers()

yes, use req.headers_out.add()

Apache cannot start after installing mod-python under Windows NT.

Windows: NT 4.0 SP6a
Apache: 1.3.22
Python: 2.1.1
mod_python: 
	mod_python.dll from python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip, 
	python\lib\mod_python from mod_python-2.7.4.tgz

Error:
Could not start the Apache on \\machinename
Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

I think I did what was described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html
With one exception, here is no mod_python-x\lib\mod_python directory instead
I got mod_python-x\lib\python\mod_python. I assumed that simply mod_python
should be in \python\lib.

Your apache is 1.3.22 and the dll is for 1.3.20. Maybe that is the problem?

That is how it should be read. \python\lib\mod_python should contain the

Traceback (most recent call last):

I guess this error occures too when tries to execute 'PythonHandler mptest'
and mptest.py fails to import apache.py module.

Right place is Apache modules directory, isn't it? Latest (or maybe I am
wrong???) precompiled version I found there is python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip
which ig got from http://www.modpython.org/dist/win/2.7.4/

You need to make sure you have the most up to date mod_python.dll file in 
the right place as well. Ensure you have the most up to date files from 
www.modpython.org

It looks like my httpd.conf was wrong. I was following description from
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html but
I didn't read comments in section AddModule of my httpd.conf: [WHENEVER YOU
CHANGE THE LOADMODULE SECTION ABOVE, UPDATE THIS TOO!]

When I added 'AddModule mod_python.c' Apache can be restarted and mptest.py
works.

I think would be nice to mention this in Windows Installation document, just
in case.

Thanks for all comments and hints,

Mariusz

Hi,
  I am new to mod_python and would like to get to know
more about it. I downloaded the source and install it
as dynamically linked module. Everything works fine. I
also get the example mptest working. However, a glitch
i encountered was the warning message when i restart
my apache. I am using RH7.1 and apache 1.3.19. WHen i
restart apache, i get this warning message:
-------------------------------------------
Stopping httpd: [OK ]
Starting httpd: [Thu Oct 25 09:43:31 2001] [warn]
Loaded DSO /usr/lib/apache/mod_python.so uses plain
Apache 1.3 API, this module might crash under EAPI!
(please recompile it with -DEAPI)
-------------------------------------
What does this really mean? 

Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <000a01c15e29$4a360990$05b450d9@apache>

Hy,

I'm completely new to mod_python (and not that good in english-speaking
;) ).
I tried to install it on my Apache 1.3.22 (Win32).
I installed Python 2.1.1, mod_python (exactly!) as described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html - I
also added
the "AddModule mod_python.c" line to my httpd.conf - everything fine so far,
Apache starts without displaying error-messages.
But: Everytime I try to execute the python-example, it displays:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
Mod_python error: "PythonHandler mptest"

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 181, in Dispatch
    module = import_module(module_name, _req)

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 335, in import_module
    f, p, d = imp.find_module(parts[i], path)

ImportError: No module named mptest


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------

Since I didn't find any mptest-module in the mod_python-2.7.6-release, I'm
just wondering - did I forget something??
There's an apache-compiled and none-compiled .py in the mod_python folder.

Regards

Stefan

Уважаемые господа!

    Что такое Информация ? 
Информация - это власть, богатство, успех, процветание.
Кто владеет информацией, тот управляет.

     Информация, которую предоставляет наша компания будет полезна, а в отдельных случаях и просто необходима, как организациям, предприятиям, так и каждому человеку и его семье.
    1. Все мы знаем слова <горный воздух>, но наверное не все знают, что его целебные свойства зависят не только от отсутствия вредных примесей, но и от наличия так называемых <отрицательных ионов> или аэроионов(АИ) кислорода.
      Деятельность "цивилизованного человечества", развитие производств с появлением гигантских "смогов" привели к резкому уменьшению количества <отрицательных ионов> в воздухе. Воздух наших жилых помещений биологически мертвый. Для сравнения: в горах Абхазии (где больше всего долгожителей) количество отрицательных аэроионов около 20 000 в 1 куб. см воздуха, в морском воздухе их 2 000, в зеленом же массиве средней полосы России - 200-1000, в производственных помещениях всего 10-20, а перед экраном телевизора или компьютера - абсолютный 0. 
      По санитарным нормам МЗ СССР уровень концентрации аэроионов, отклонение от которого создает угрозу здоровью человека - находится в диапазоне от 600 АИ до 50000 АИ в куб.см.!!!!!
         Все это приводит к болезням, ослаблению имунитета, сокращению жизни.
        Внешние факторы защиты уже не помогают. Требуется вмешательство искусственным путем. И здесь важную роль могут сыграть искусственные генераторы отрицательных аэроионов - аэроионизаторы или как их еще называют - "Люстры Чижевского". Они создают достаточную для жизненных процессов концентрацию отрицательных аэроионов, порядка 20 000 - 30 000 в 1 куб.см, имитируя условия горной местности или Черноморского побережья Крыма или Кавказа. В этих условиях человек испытывает комфортное состояние, приобретает здоровье и продляет себе жизнь.
       Наша организация продаёт данные люстры (четыре модели) собранные непосредственно по чертежам самого А.Л. Чижевского оптом и в розницу.
      О здоровье необходимо заботиться сейчас, не откладывая на потом. Ведь, как известно здоровье не купишь.

        Вся информация о товарах нашей компании на сайте: www.viel.f2s.com 

     2. Мы предлагаем надежную замену электрическим чайникам -аппараты для нагрева и охлаждения питьевой воды( кулеры), а также аппараты газводы для <горячих> цехов и предприятий(АВ-2,АВ-3,POST-MIX и др).
    Кулеры-очень удобны при использовании в офисах , где они бесперебойно обеспечивают холодной водой или горячими напитками. 
    Они совмещают функции чайника и охладителя, позволяющие мгновенно воспользоваться горячей или холодной питьевой водой. Это значительно облегчает приготовление чая, кофе, растворимых супов, а также охлажденных напитков.
Начав пользоваться нашими аппаратами в быту и на работе, вы не вернетесь к пользованию чайником и водой из под крана. 
     Настольные модели идеально подходят для домашнего использования. Они не занимают много места и прекрасно вписываются в интерьер современной кухни. Снижается расход электроэнергии - нагрев воду, кулер автоматически переключается в режим ожидания и включит нагрев снова, когда температура воды в термосе опустится до 85°С..

        3. Область электроники, это не только поставки приборов, аппаратуры, но и различные комплектующие как отечественных, так и зарубежных производителей электронной техники. Это такие фирмы как International Rectifier, Epcos,Bourns, Metex, unit-t и др.
        4. Сварочные электроды: мы продаём электроды от ведущих отечественных производителей. Все сварочные электроды соответствуют ГОСТу и имеют сертификат качества. Также мы предлагаем Х/К и Г/К листовой металлопркат.
В настоящее время мы предлагаем уникальную разработку отечественных ученых: компенсирующие патрубки для безсварного соединения металлических труб!!!(D от 25 до 1000мм.)
          Наши менеджеры имеют богатый опыт продаж, маркетинговых исследований, ведения переговоров с крупными поставщиками и потребителями товаров, что позволяет нам достать нужную Вам продукцию по выгодным для Вас ценам и в оптимально короткие сроки.
         Рассмотрим интересные предложения(по приемлемым, конкурирующим ценам)сбыта продукции Вашего предприятия, а также возможен вариант рассмотрения поставки товаров, которые не вошли в сферу деятельности нашей организации!!!

Hi All,

I compiled mod_python 2.7.6 in Linux RedHat 7.0. Trying to start Apache I
get:

[root@spongebob bin]# ./apachectl start
Syntax error on line 235 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_python.so into server: undefined

I'm lost. Any direction/hint VERY welcomed!

PS: To compile, I used:

[root@spongebob /root]# /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -I include -I
/usr/include/python1.5 -c mod_python.c
/usr/lib/python1.5/config/libpython1.5.a -lpthread

Grisha,

Thanks for your answer.

I compiled Apache for DSO support. Will ./configure and make do?

Thanks again,

Grisha,

The problem was I was specifying the apxs directory instead of the
executable (full path+name) in ./configure.

Thanks.

Actually, no!

Had the same problem a few weeks, with a new python, apache and mod_python.
Making a script.pyc solved it, haven`t look into it yet.

I have heard of others beside me having the same problem (all using Debian), 
so I thought this problem was very common. At least I believed that an 
'official' patch was available.

I will live with my own patch - which I don't consider permanent - until 
things solve themselves with a new release or combination of 
Apache/Python/mod_python.

If anybody finds a better patch or solution I'll be happy hearing about it.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: [mod_python] Problems re-using a child's python interpreter
Message-ID: <200110032219.f93MJGD21539@eden.ispol.com>

mod_python: Version 2.7.6
apache: 1.3.14

Hi folks,

I wrote a sort of minimal 'content management helper', that translates
XML to html and inserts dynamically created content on the
fly. Nothing fancy, but it works - thought I, untill I found out it
dosn't.

My python handler looks like this:

from mod_python import apache
import logic.util

def handler(req):
    req.content_type = "text/html"
    req.send_http_header()    

    rendering = logic.util.getRendering(req.filename, req)
    rendering = logic.util.insertDynamicContent(req, rendering)
    req.write(rendering)
    
    return apache.OK

The directory it's supposed to work in is:

<Directory /var/public_html/ted-magoo.de/domains/some-domain.de/www>
  AddHandler python-program .xml
  PythonHandler roteerde
  PythonDebug On
  DirectoryIndex index.xml
  PythonInterpPerDirectory On
</Directory>

There is a 'logic' dir below the 'www' directory that contains a
__init__.py and a util.py to make the import above work. And so it
does until I created a second domain with the same setup and (nearly)
the same files. I can access both directories at a time, but as soon I
access one and than the other I get an apache error like:

make_obcallback(): could not import mod_python.apache.
make_obcallback(): could not call init.
[Wed Oct  3 15:42:38 2001] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] python_handler:
make_obcallback returned no obCallBack]

I figured out that this has something to do with python being unable
to find some modules. So I set a very long PYTHONPATH width all module
paths on it before starting apache. Now I get all sorts of unrelated
module-not-found errors. However, this only happens sometimes! Every
second request or so gives me an error message or an error 500.

My attempts debugging seem to indicate that errors do not occur when
apache created a new sub-process and with it a new python interpreter
to answer the request. So the only solution I came up with is setting

MaxRequestsPerChild 1

in http.conf. This lets apache sub-processes die as soon they answered
a request. Of course it creates an enormous overhead.

I'd greatly appreciate any ideas you have to solve the problem. I am
sure you are facing similar problems when creating complex web
applications with mod_python. What design patterns do you use to do
so?

Regards
Diedrich

Doubtful. By default mod_python creaes a new sub-interpreter per
virtual server. Since I'm using my computer at home right now to try
things out that would always (for both projects) be 'localhost'. Using
this directive causes mod_python to create a new interpreter for each
directory (project) so I can use the same identifyers without name-clashes.

I tried it that way, too. Also using

   PythonInterpPerDirective On

had have no effect.

Using none of the obove causes one of web-sites to appear in the
layout of the other, because the 'look' depends on a page.py in each
project's directory.

Diedrich

Uhh... I see I didn't have to explain how mod_python works to
*you*... :-)

Subject: [mod_python] About authentication
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.10.10110041113020.7933-100000@mrham.hamslab.com>

I'm trying to implement custom authentication using authenhandler.
I want to save user info and password in encrypted file that other users
can only read. So I've tried to use md5.new('password').hexdigest().
'password' is a variable that stores password using 
req.get_basic_auth_pw().

When I've tried to load restricted page, I got error saying 'password'
variable is not read-only buffer, but None. I can use direct comparison
of username and password with string as to the mod_python document, but I
can't use it in a function that accepts string as a argument.

Any comment or help would be appreciated.
mod_python is 2.7.2.

If you look in the src/Makefile.in you'll see something about _eprintf.o,
this looks to be the same kind of problem. I am not sure what causes this
exactly, but for some reason gcc on solaris has this behaviour of not
including certain files.

Try this:

(in mod_python directory)

$ cd src
$ ar -x `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name` _eprintf.o
(this should create an _muldi3.o file)

In src/Makefile, somewhere below "OBJS=" add _multi3.0 after _eprintf.o

$ rm mod_python.so
$ make mod_python.so

HTH,

Grisha

Hello All,
	I am using Apache 1.13.20, Python 2.1.1 and modpython 2.7.6 on Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.
	I am also using the publisher handler to publish my pages.
	This all work very well and is nice and speedy.
	However, when I try and add a CleanupHandler I get the following in my logs:
	
	[notice] child pid 1787 exit signal Segmentation fault (11)
	
	Apache does not crash. Only the child thread does.
	
	Without the CleanupHandler everything is fine.
	
	The relevant apache conf:
	
	# httpd.conf
	<Directory /var/www/site-foobar/wwwroot/mod-python>
		SetHandler python-program
		PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
		PythonCleanupHandler cleanup
		PythonDebug On
	</Directory>

	My cleanup handler looks like this (for debugging I've taken everything out.) :
	# cleanup.py
	
	def cleanuphandler(req):
		return apache.OK
	
	Has anybody else had this problem or can anybody suggest a fix?

	Thanks,
		Chaitan
	
	PS. The following may also be relevant.
	1) Python is compiled without threads.
	2) I have tried sticking -DEAPI in the Makefile.
	3) I have also not stuck -DEAPI in the modpython Makefile. 
	I don't know which is correct but the former stopped apache from complaining on startup.

Subject: [mod_python] Reload problem - again!
Message-ID: <200110152159.f9FLx4N09351@usr00.cybercity.dk>

Hi,

I still have a reload problem when using mod_python. From the error_log below 
it can be seen (last line) that apache searches for a file called 'myfile.p'. 
What happend to the last 'y' in '.py' ?

I'm still using my homemade workaround, but I'm not sure this is the right 
way to do it. I'm using python 2.2.1 and I have just installed mod_python 
2.7.6 and apache 1.3.20, but the reload problem is still there. Is this 
really only a problem on my system?

My homemade workaround in apache.py (line 356,359) is as follows:

            # check also .py and take the newest
            ## if os.path.exists(filepath[:-1]) :
            if os.path.exists(filepath[:]):

                # get the time of the .py file
                ## mod = os.stat(filepath[:-1])
                mod = os.stat(filepath[:])
                mtime = max(mtime, mod[stat.ST_MTIME])


In filepath[:-1] I have just removed '-1'. Well, it works for me at the 
moment, but I'm afraid that someday nothing will work because of this 
modification. Could there be something else wrong with my configuration? If 
anybody have an idea I'm happy to hear about it.

Thanks in advance!
Br.

The problem isn't with the "[:-1]", it's that os.path.exists() *raises* an
error. It's not supposed to raise errors, just return true or false (at
least according to documentation):

http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-os.path.html

This is a Python bug that begins in 2.1 and is still in 2.2a1, but seems
to be fixed in 2.2a4.

This is also in the mod_python FAQ, and there is a link there to a patch
;-)

THANK YOU :-))
Now everything seems to work just fine :-)
I installed python 2.2a4 and recompiled everything. Now it just runs smoothly 
(at least my simple example). But now I'm eager to put on more python etc. 
Additionally I had to upgrade to MySQL-python0.9.1c2 to get my database interface to work again.

Thank you again!

Is it possible to set multiple cookies through the Request object?

Request req

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "first=value1"
This works to set the first cookie

req.headers_out[ "Set-Cookie"]  = "second=value2"
The second cookie will overwrite the  first in the req.headers_out list
before calling
req.send_http_headers()

yes, use req.headers_out.add()

Apache cannot start after installing mod-python under Windows NT.

Windows: NT 4.0 SP6a
Apache: 1.3.22
Python: 2.1.1
mod_python: 
	mod_python.dll from python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip, 
	python\lib\mod_python from mod_python-2.7.4.tgz

Error:
Could not start the Apache on \\machinename
Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

I think I did what was described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html
With one exception, here is no mod_python-x\lib\mod_python directory instead
I got mod_python-x\lib\python\mod_python. I assumed that simply mod_python
should be in \python\lib.

Your apache is 1.3.22 and the dll is for 1.3.20. Maybe that is the problem?

That is how it should be read. \python\lib\mod_python should contain the

I am trying to check different things. When I tried manually compile
apache.py in \lib\mod_python dirctory I got this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

I guess this error occures too when tries to execute 'PythonHandler mptest'
and mptest.py fails to import apache.py module.

Right place is Apache modules directory, isn't it? Latest (or maybe I am
wrong???) precompiled version I found there is python2.1-apache1.3.20.zip
which ig got from http://www.modpython.org/dist/win/2.7.4/

You need to make sure you have the most up to date mod_python.dll file in 
the right place as well. Ensure you have the most up to date files from 
www.modpython.org

It looks like my httpd.conf was wrong. I was following description from
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html but
I didn't read comments in section AddModule of my httpd.conf: [WHENEVER YOU
CHANGE THE LOADMODULE SECTION ABOVE, UPDATE THIS TOO!]

When I added 'AddModule mod_python.c' Apache can be restarted and mptest.py
works.

I think would be nice to mention this in Windows Installation document, just
in case.

Thanks for all comments and hints,

Mariusz

Hi,
  I am new to mod_python and would like to get to know
more about it. I downloaded the source and install it
as dynamically linked module. Everything works fine. I
also get the example mptest working. However, a glitch
i encountered was the warning message when i restart
my apache. I am using RH7.1 and apache 1.3.19. WHen i
restart apache, i get this warning message:
-------------------------------------------
Stopping httpd: [OK ]
Starting httpd: [Thu Oct 25 09:43:31 2001] [warn]
Loaded DSO /usr/lib/apache/mod_python.so uses plain
Apache 1.3 API, this module might crash under EAPI!
(please recompile it with -DEAPI)
-------------------------------------
What does this really mean? 

Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <000a01c15e29$4a360990$05b450d9@apache>

Hy,

I'm completely new to mod_python (and not that good in english-speaking
;) ).
I tried to install it on my Apache 1.3.22 (Win32).
I installed Python 2.1.1, mod_python (exactly!) as described in
http://www.modpython.org/live/mod_python-2.7.6/doc-html/app-wininst.html - I
also added
the "AddModule mod_python.c" line to my httpd.conf - everything fine so far,
Apache starts without displaying error-messages.
But: Everytime I try to execute the python-example, it displays:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
Mod_python error: "PythonHandler mptest"

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 181, in Dispatch
    module = import_module(module_name, _req)

  File "D:\Python21\Lib\mod_python\apache.py", line 335, in import_module
    f, p, d = imp.find_module(parts[i], path)

ImportError: No module named mptest


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------

Since I didn't find any mptest-module in the mod_python-2.7.6-release, I'm
just wondering - did I forget something??
There's an apache-compiled and none-compiled .py in the mod_python folder.

Regards

Stefan

Уважаемые господа!

    Что такое Информация ? 
Информация - это власть, богатство, успех, процветание.
Кто владеет информацией, тот управляет.

     Информация, которую предоставляет наша компания будет полезна, а в отдельных случаях и просто необходима, как организациям, предприятиям, так и каждому человеку и его семье.
    1. Все мы знаем слова <горный воздух>, но наверное не все знают, что его целебные свойства зависят не только от отсутствия вредных примесей, но и от наличия так называемых <отрицательных ионов> или аэроионов(АИ) кислорода.
      Деятельность "цивилизованного человечества", развитие производств с появлением гигантских "смогов" привели к резкому уменьшению количества <отрицательных ионов> в воздухе. Воздух наших жилых помещений биологически мертвый. Для сравнения: в горах Абхазии (где больше всего долгожителей) количество отрицательных аэроионов около 20 000 в 1 куб. см воздуха, в морском воздухе их 2 000, в зеленом же массиве средней полосы России - 200-1000, в производственных помещениях всего 10-20, а перед экраном телевизора или компьютера - абсолютный 0. 
      По санитарным нормам МЗ СССР уровень концентрации аэроионов, отклонение от которого создает угрозу здоровью человека - находится в диапазоне от 600 АИ до 50000 АИ в куб.см.!!!!!
         Все это приводит к болезням, ослаблению имунитета, сокращению жизни.
        Внешние факторы защиты уже не помогают. Требуется вмешательство искусственным путем. И здесь важную роль могут сыграть искусственные генераторы отрицательных аэроионов - аэроионизаторы или как их еще называют - "Люстры Чижевского". Они создают достаточную для жизненных процессов концентрацию отрицательных аэроионов, порядка 20 000 - 30 000 в 1 куб.см, имитируя условия горной местности или Черноморского побережья Крыма или Кавказа. В этих условиях человек испытывает комфортное состояние, приобретает здоровье и продляет себе жизнь.
       Наша организация продаёт данные люстры (четыре модели) собранные непосредственно по чертежам самого А.Л. Чижевского оптом и в розницу.
      О здоровье необходимо заботиться сейчас, не откладывая на потом. Ведь, как известно здоровье не купишь.

        Вся информация о товарах нашей компании на сайте: www.viel.f2s.com 

     2. Мы предлагаем надежную замену электрическим чайникам -аппараты для нагрева и охлаждения питьевой воды( кулеры), а также аппараты газводы для <горячих> цехов и предприятий(АВ-2,АВ-3,POST-MIX и др).
    Кулеры-очень удобны при использовании в офисах , где они бесперебойно обеспечивают холодной водой или горячими напитками. 
    Они совмещают функции чайника и охладителя, позволяющие мгновенно воспользоваться горячей или холодной питьевой водой. Это значительно облегчает приготовление чая, кофе, растворимых супов, а также охлажденных напитков.
Начав пользоваться нашими аппаратами в быту и на работе, вы не вернетесь к пользованию чайником и водой из под крана. 
     Настольные модели идеально подходят для домашнего использования. Они не занимают много места и прекрасно вписываются в интерьер современной кухни. Снижается расход электроэнергии - нагрев воду, кулер автоматически переключается в режим ожидания и включит нагрев снова, когда температура воды в термосе опустится до 85°С..

        3. Область электроники, это не только поставки приборов, аппаратуры, но и различные комплектующие как отечественных, так и зарубежных производителей электронной техники. Это такие фирмы как International Rectifier, Epcos,Bourns, Metex, unit-t и др.
        4. Сварочные электроды: мы продаём электроды от ведущих отечественных производителей. Все сварочные электроды соответствуют ГОСТу и имеют сертификат качества. Также мы предлагаем Х/К и Г/К листовой металлопркат.
В настоящее время мы предлагаем уникальную разработку отечественных ученых: компенсирующие патрубки для безсварного соединения металлических труб!!!(D от 25 до 1000мм.)
          Наши менеджеры имеют богатый опыт продаж, маркетинговых исследований, ведения переговоров с крупными поставщиками и потребителями товаров, что позволяет нам достать нужную Вам продукцию по выгодным для Вас ценам и в оптимально короткие сроки.
         Рассмотрим интересные предложения(по приемлемым, конкурирующим ценам)сбыта продукции Вашего предприятия, а также возможен вариант рассмотрения поставки товаров, которые не вошли в сферу деятельности нашей организации!!!

Hi All,

I compiled mod_python 2.7.6 in Linux RedHat 7.0. Trying to start Apache I
get:

[root@spongebob bin]# ./apachectl start
Syntax error on line 235 of /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_python.so into server: undefined
symbol:

./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

I'm lost. Any direction/hint VERY welcomed!

Ed.

PS: To compile, I used:

[root@spongebob /root]# /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -I include -I

Grisha,

Thanks for your answer.

I compiled Apache for DSO support. Will ./configure and make do?

Thanks again,

Ed.

Grisha,

The problem was I was specifying the apxs directory instead of the
