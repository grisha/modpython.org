Subject: [mod_python] Configuring Apache with mod_python for WSGI
Message-ID: <4D6D22BC-D263-44EE-BBA7-922143A52C9D@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to configure my Apache/mod_python setup (Apache/2.4.16 (Unix) mod_python/3.5.0- Python/3.4.0) to work with Falcon (http://falconframework.org) and I am following the steps located in the modpython.org docs under the WSGI Handler section (http://modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/handlers.html#wsgi-handler).

I can?t get any of that section to work, and frankly it doesn?t really make sense.
For example you are making the file named wsgi.py but then in the config you call mysite.wsgi which has never been mentioned anywhere, so I am not sure what it is supposed to be. It almost seems like a typo, however trying wsgi.py on my server didn?t work either.

Has anyone ever used Falcon with mod_python before?

Any help would be very appreciative.

-Dallas

I think the docs are correct. The key thing being "Assuming there
exists the following minimal WSGI app residing in a file named
mysite/wsgi.py in directory /path/to/mysite (so that the full path to
wsgi.py is /path/to/mysite/mysite/wsgi.py)" (note how mysite is in the
path twice).

And then what enables Python to find it is:

PythonPath "sys.path+['/path/to/mysite']"

I don't know much about Falcon though, sorry.

Regards,

Grisha

Ok, but that still leaves the question as to what the wsgi.py file is and what the mysite.wsgi file is?
The docs are not clear as to which one holds the listed ?def application()? ?hello world? code, and what the other one is.

Thanks for the insight on the double paths, I will give that a try once I figure out the above file issue.

That's just normal Python semantics: when a .py file is in a
directory, you import it by using the directory name (which
technically becomes a package name) followed by the file name without
the extension. So in this case we have a directory (package) called
"mysite", and in it a module called "wsgi.py", so in the configuration
we specify is as "mysite.wsgi"
