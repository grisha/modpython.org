</I>
Your argument holds a lot of water, and you've described the situation 
very well. But I feel that Publisher is very simple, and a decent manual 
  would only be a few pages long. After reading it, a user could sit 
down with &quot;Learning Python&quot; and immediately start writing a web 
application. Little tweaks that start giving Publisher its own syntax 
could also interfere with good mental health.

&gt;<i> Another proof that mixing published and standard module is a bad
</I>&gt;<i> design choice is that you end up putting constraints (through the path
</I>&gt;<i> parameter in import_module) to make sure that only modules from the
</I>&gt;<i> published filesystem are published. This is inefficient at best. Have
</I>&gt;<i> a look at what CherryPy does, for example : function and object which
</I>&gt;<i> can be published are just marked as such. Anything else can't be
</I>&gt;<i> published. There's no need to worry about path restrictions and so on
</I>&gt;<i> and so forth.
</I>
Yes, but I think that Publisher is meant to be more of a transparent 
interface between apache and Python, with some useful conveniences 
thrown in for web development. I don't find myself thinking much about 
Publisher internals when I'm developing an application. CherryPy 
requirements are a lot more prominent in the code.

&gt;<i> I'm sorry to be a little harsh on the subject, but for now, I think
</I>&gt;<i> mod_python is far from being an user-friendly web development
</I>&gt;<i> environment. 
</I>
True, especially if you're expecting something with a builtin for every 
purpose. But I find it to be a transparent, programmer-friendly 
environment, because I just need to use ordinary Python commands and 
packages. I immediately develop reusable code, including code that isn't 
restricted to mod_python or web applications (parsing an Excel file, for 
example). I've even written modules that can run as a standalone web 
application, a command line application, or imported into another 
module, all in one file. I'd hate to see special syntax added to 
Publisher that makes this impossible. I *like* using ordinary import 
statements. :)

&gt;<i> For power users who can wrap their head around the
</I>&gt;<i> various bugs^H^H^H^Hfeatures, it's perfect, but judging from the
</I>&gt;<i> volumes of &quot;Can't make mptest.py to run&quot; or &quot;Can't import yada_yada
</I>&gt;<i> module from index.py&quot; messages, there's still a lot of things to cope
</I>&gt;<i> with to get a bigger user base. I definitely think the import
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism and mod_python.publisher need urgent and radical
</I>&gt;<i> improvements.
</I>
I rarely encounter software that works reliably and predictably well, 
and I include Publisher in that category. When something &quot;just works&quot; 
for me, talk of improving, fixing, or eliminating it makes me nervous. 
I'm not terribly motivated by joining a larger herd (I've gotten used to 
all of my favorite TV shows being cancelled). But there *are* choices, 
including Publisher, CherryPy, Vampire, mpservlets, etc. My concern is 
that Publisher will be turned into something more like the others, 
thereby eliminating my choice.
