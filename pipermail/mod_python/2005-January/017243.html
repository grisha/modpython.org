<PRE>Gents,

Appreciate the help for this python newbie.  I do recognize that the error 
message changed when the full path is provided (as I noted in the bottom of 
the first message) either when hard coded or using the __file__ to extract 
it.  Regarding the rest:
1) Code snippets - With the exception of the apache config excerpt the code 
posted was the entire file boiled down from examples I had found on various 
template sites.
2) Basics - Done that.  I have several working .py files in the 
/var/www/pythontest directory from simple &quot;hello world&quot; types up to a local 
mysql database access and dump, all via the browser so I know the files are 
accessible and work fine.  The problem was in going to the next step 
(referencing local files).
3) Index missing - Based on the posted comments I've wrapped the original 
template code in a def index the following
from simpletal import simpleTAL, simpleTALES
import sys
import os

def index(req):
    filepath = &quot;%s/basic.html&quot; % os.path.dirname(__file__)
    templateFile = open (filepath, 'r')
    templateFile.close()

This gets me this error when I used &quot;<A HREF="http://192.168.0.12/pythontest/a.py&quot;">http://192.168.0.12/pythontest/a.py&quot;</A> :
500 Internal Server Error
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable 
to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator, <A HREF="http://mailman.modpython.org/mailman/listinfo/mod_python">webmaster at Knoppix</A> and inform them 
of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may 
have caused the error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

4)  Full apache config below - Hope you see something:
##
## httpd.conf -- Apache HTTP server configuration file
##

#
# Based upon the NCSA server configuration files originally by Rob McCool.
#
# This is the main Apache server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/">http://www.apache.org/docs/</A>&gt; for detailed information about
# the directives.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.
#
# After this file is processed, the server will look for and process
# /etc/apache/srm.conf and then /etc/apache/access.conf
# unless you have overridden these with ResourceConfig and/or
# AccessConfig directives here.
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the Apache server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same Apache server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with &quot;/&quot; (or &quot;drive:/&quot; for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with &quot;/&quot;, the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so &quot;logs/foo.log&quot;
# with ServerRoot set to &quot;/usr/local/apache&quot; will be interpreted by the
# server as &quot;/usr/local/apache/logs/foo.log&quot;.
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of Apache,
# such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where it
# can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerType is either inetd, or standalone.  Inetd mode is only supported on
# Unix platforms.
#
ServerType standalone

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# NOTE!  If you intend to place this on an NFS (or otherwise network)
# mounted filesystem then please read the LockFile documentation
# (available at &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#lockfile">http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#lockfile</A>&gt;);
# you will save yourself a lot of trouble.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot /etc/apache

#
# The LockFile directive sets the path to the lockfile used when Apache
# is compiled with either USE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT or
# USE_FLOCK_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT. This directive should normally be left at
# its default value. The main reason for changing it is if the logs
# directory is NFS mounted, since the lockfile MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL
# DISK. The PID of the main server process is automatically appended to
# the filename.
#
LockFile /var/lock/apache.lock

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
PidFile /var/run/apache.pid

#
# ScoreBoardFile: File used to store internal server process information.
# Not all architectures require this.  But if yours does (you'll know because
# this file will be  created when you run Apache) then you *must* ensure that
# no two invocations of Apache share the same scoreboard file.
#
ScoreBoardFile /var/run/apache.scoreboard

#
# In the standard configuration, the server will process this file,
# srm.conf, and access.conf in that order.  The latter two files are
# now distributed empty, as it is recommended that all directives
# be kept in a single file for simplicity.  The commented-out values
# below are the built-in defaults.  You can have the server ignore
# these files altogether by using &quot;/dev/null&quot; (for Unix) or
# &quot;nul&quot; (for Win32) for the arguments to the directives.
#
#ResourceConfig /etc/apache/srm.conf
#AccessConfig /etc/apache/access.conf

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to &quot;Off&quot; to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 15

#
# Server-pool size regulation.  Rather than making you guess how many
# server processes you need, Apache dynamically adapts to the load it
# sees --- that is, it tries to maintain enough server processes to
# handle the current load, plus a few spare servers to handle transient
# load spikes (e.g., multiple simultaneous requests from a single
# Netscape browser).
#
# It does this by periodically checking how many servers are waiting
# for a request.  If there are fewer than MinSpareServers, it creates
# a new spare.  If there are more than MaxSpareServers, some of the
# spares die off.  The default values are probably OK for most sites.
#
MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 20

#
# Number of servers to start initially --- should be a reasonable ballpark
# figure.
#
StartServers 5

#
# Limit on total number of servers running, i.e., limit on the number
# of clients who can simultaneously connect --- if this limit is ever
# reached, clients will be LOCKED OUT, so it should NOT BE SET TOO LOW.
# It is intended mainly as a brake to keep a runaway server from taking
# the system with it as it spirals down...
#
MaxClients 150

#
# MaxRequestsPerChild: the number of requests each child process is
# allowed to process before the child dies.  The child will exit so
# as to avoid problems after prolonged use when Apache (and maybe the
# libraries it uses) leak memory or other resources.  On most systems, this
# isn't really needed, but a few (such as Solaris) do have notable leaks
# in the libraries. For these platforms, set to something like 10000
# or so; a setting of 0 means unlimited.
#
# NOTE: This value does not include keepalive requests after the initial
#       request per connection. For example, if a child process handles
#       an initial request and 10 subsequent &quot;keptalive&quot; requests, it
#       would only count as 1 request towards this limit.
#
MaxRequestsPerChild 100

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, in addition to the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
# directive.
#
#Listen 3000
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

#
# BindAddress: You can support virtual hosts with this option. This directive
# is used to tell the server which IP address to listen to. It can either
# contain &quot;*&quot;, an IP address, or a fully qualified Internet domain name.
# See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt; and Listen directives.
#
#BindAddress *

#
# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
# To be able to use the functionality of a module which was built as a DSO you
# have to place corresponding `LoadModule' lines at this location so the
# directives contained in it are actually available _before_ they are used.
# Please read the file README.DSO in the Apache 1.3 distribution for more
# details about the DSO mechanism and run `apache -l' for the list of already
# built-in (statically linked and thus always available) modules in your apache
# binary.
#
# Please keep this LoadModule: line here, it is needed for installation.
Include /etc/apache/modules.conf

#
# ExtendedStatus: controls whether Apache will generate &quot;full&quot; status
# information (ExtendedStatus On) or just basic information (ExtendedStatus
# Off) when the &quot;server-status&quot; handler is called. The default is Off.
#
ExtendedStatus On

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# &lt;VirtualHost&gt; definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any &lt;VirtualHost&gt; containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside &lt;VirtualHost&gt; containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# If your ServerType directive (set earlier in the 'Global Environment'
# section) is set to &quot;inetd&quot;, the next few directives don't have any
# effect since their settings are defined by the inetd configuration.
# Skip ahead to the ServerAdmin directive.
#

#
# Port: The port to which the standalone server listens. For
# ports &lt; 1023, you will need apache to be run as root initially.
#
Port 80

#
# If you wish apache to run as a different user or group, you must run
# apacheas root initially and it will switch.
#
# User/Group: The name (or #number) of the user/group to run apache as.
#  . On SCO (ODT 3) use &quot;User nouser&quot; and &quot;Group nogroup&quot;.
#  . On HPUX you may not be able to use shared memory as nobody, and the
#    suggested workaround is to create a user www and use that user.
#  NOTE that some kernels refuse to setgid(Group) or semctl(IPC_SET)
#  when the value of (unsigned)Group is above 60000;
#  don't use Group nobody on these systems!
#
User www-data
Group www-data

#
# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.
#
ServerAdmin <A HREF="http://mailman.modpython.org/mailman/listinfo/mod_python">webmaster at Knoppix</A>

#
# ServerName: allows you to set a host name which is sent back to clients for
# your server if it's different than the one the program would get (i.e., use
# &quot;www&quot; instead of the host's real name).
#
# Note: You cannot just invent host names and hope they work. The name you
# define here must be a valid DNS name for your host. If you don't understand
# this, ask your network administrator.
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address (e.g., <A HREF="http://123.45.67.89/">http://123.45.67.89/</A>)
# anyway, and this will make redirections work in a sensible way.
ServerName 192.168.0.12
#
#ServerName new.host.name

#
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
DocumentRoot &quot;/var/www&quot;

#
# Each directory to which Apache has access, can be configured with respect
# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that
# directory (and its subdirectories).
#
# First, we configure the &quot;default&quot; to be a very restrictive set of
# permissions.
#
&lt;Directory /&gt;
     #Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
     Options FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride None
&lt;/Directory&gt;

#
# Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow
# particular features to be enabled - so if something's not working as
# you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it
# below.
#

#
# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#
&lt;Directory &quot;/var/www/&quot;&gt;

#
# This may also be &quot;None&quot;, &quot;All&quot;, or any combination of &quot;Indexes&quot;,
# &quot;Includes&quot;, &quot;FollowSymLinks&quot;, &quot;ExecCGI&quot;, or &quot;MultiViews&quot;.
#
# Note that &quot;MultiViews&quot; must be named *explicitly* --- &quot;Options All&quot;
# doesn't give it to you.
#
     Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI

#
# This controls which options the .htaccess files in directories can

# directory if a ~user request is received.
#
&lt;IfModule mod_userdir.c&gt;
     UserDir public_html
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

#

#
# The following lines prevent .htaccess files from being viewed by
# Web clients.  Since .htaccess files often contain authorization
# information, access is disallowed for security reasons.  Comment
# these lines out if you want Web visitors to see the contents of
# .htaccess files.  If you change the AccessFileName directive above,
# be sure to make the corresponding changes here.
#
# Also, folks tend to use names such as .htpasswd for password
# files, so this will protect those as well.
#
&lt;Files ~ &quot;^\.ht&quot;&gt;

#
# CacheNegotiatedDocs: By default, Apache sends &quot;Pragma: no-cache&quot; with each
# document that was negotiated on the basis of content. This asks proxy
# servers not to cache the document. Uncommenting the following line disables
# this behavior, and proxies will be allowed to cache the documents.
#
#CacheNegotiatedDocs

#
# UseCanonicalName:  (new for 1.3)  With this setting turned on, whenever
# Apache needs to construct a self-referencing URL (a URL that refers back
# to the server the response is coming from) it will use ServerName and
# Port to form a &quot;canonical&quot; name.  With this setting off, Apache will
# use the hostname:port that the client supplied, when possible.  This
# also affects SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT in CGI scripts.
#
UseCanonicalName On

#
# TypesConfig describes where the mime.types file (or equivalent) is
# to be found.
#
TypesConfig /etc/mime.types

#
# DefaultType is the default MIME type the server will use for a document
# if it cannot otherwise determine one, such as from filename extensions.
# If your server contains mostly text or HTML documents, &quot;text/plain&quot; is
# a good value.  If most of your content is binary, such as applications
# or images, you may want to use &quot;application/octet-stream&quot; instead to
# keep browsers from trying to display binary files as though they are
# text.
#
DefaultType text/plain

#
# The mod_mime_magic module allows the server to use various hints from the
# contents of the file itself to determine its type.  The MIMEMagicFile
# directive tells the module where the hint definitions are located.
# mod_mime_magic is not part of the default server (you have to add
# it yourself with a LoadModule [see the DSO paragraph in the 'Global
# Environment' section], or recompile the server and include mod_mime_magic
# as part of the configuration), so it's enclosed in an &lt;IfModule&gt; container.
# This means that the MIMEMagicFile directive will only be processed if the
# module is part of the server.
#
&lt;IfModule mod_mime_magic.c&gt;

#
# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
#
HostnameLookups Off

#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be

### Section 3: Virtual Hosts
#
# VirtualHost: If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them.
# Please see the documentation at &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/">http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/</A>&gt;
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# If you want to use name-based virtual hosts you need to define at
# least one IP address (and port number) for them.
#
#NameVirtualHost 12.34.56.78:80
#NameVirtualHost 12.34.56.78

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
#
#&lt;VirtualHost ip.address.of.host.some_domain.com&gt;
#    ServerAdmin <A HREF="http://mailman.modpython.org/mailman/listinfo/mod_python">webmaster at host.some_domain.com</A>
#    DocumentRoot /www/docs/host.some_domain.com
#    ServerName host.some_domain.com
#    ErrorLog logs/host.some_domain.com-error.log
#    CustomLog logs/host.some_domain.com-access.log common
#&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

#&lt;VirtualHost _default_:*&gt;
#&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

# Automatically added by the post-installation script
# as part of the transition to a config directory layout
# similar to apache2, and that will help users to migrate
# from apache to apache2 or revert back easily
Include /etc/apache/conf.d
