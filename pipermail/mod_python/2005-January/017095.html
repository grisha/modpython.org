<PRE>answering to myself, i might have found a way: use a PUT method in the 
form to upload the file to a specific place on the server, and when the 
client's popup reloads, i just check the size of the file so far. i'd 
use an authhandler to check each PUT request to make sure i was waiting 
for it. i haven't tried it yet, but it sounds feasible.

does anyone have any comments? code examples? experiences?
it would be much appreciated...

i also saw that i could do this in mod_python 3 with an input filter, 
but i'd prefer something that works with apache 1.x as well, if i can 
help it, as many many people, including myself, have been sticking with it.

thank you!
