<PRE>Porcari,

It's some time since you posted so perhaps you solved the problem  
already.

In any case I recently ran into it myself and despite finding dozens  
of reports of this problem on the internet I didn't find any  
explanation. Now that I've found the answer (for myself at least) I  
thought I'd better post it. That way if I forget what it was, and run  
into it again, at least maybe I'll find my own post :-)

The warnings are easily dealt with as another poster already noted:  
simply delete the -arch i386 flag from the configure-generated  
Makefile. It's the link errors that are the real problem. In fact  
they are not really related to mod_python. I also got them when I  
first tried to build boost_python on my Mac.

The reason I had this problem, on Mac OSX 10.3.9 (not Server version  
in my case), was because I had installed newer versions of Python  
alongside the built-in version 2.3.

Now, I don't know how to build mod_python against any of those newer  
pythons. The link error is there because they expect something to be  
in the libSystem library which isn't. I doubt there is much that can  
be done about that.

What you can do however is build mod_python against the built-in  
python. Specify

   --with-python=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/ 
2.3/bin/python2.3

when you ./configure. That unfortunately doesn't stop the compiler  
(libtool/gcc) from looking at the wrong python when it comes to link  
time. So you also need to edit src/Makefile. I added the following  
flag (just before the -framework Python flag in the LDFLAGS line):

   -Wl,-F/System/Library/Frameworks

That tells the linker to look first for the python framework in / 
System/Library/Frameworks which is where the built-in one lives.

And then of course you'll have to install everything you installed  
for Python 2.4 or 2.5 again for 2.3. Such is life.

Oliver
