Options for running web applications written in Python are as follows:

1. Web server is actually written in Python and Python web application
sits on top of that in the same process. This web server may be the
direct public facing web server, or may be hosted behind another web
server such as Apache, lighttpd or nginx, with requests being proxied
from the front end web server using the corresponding mod_proxy like
module for the front end web server. There are various web servers
available written in Python.

2. Python web application runs within an instance of the Python
interpreter which runs embedded within a web server which is written
in C. This option only currently exists for Apache. Two Apache modules
exist for this. These are mod_python and mod_wsgi
(<A HREF="http://www.modwsgi.org">http://www.modwsgi.org</A>).

You obviously know about mod_python. Whereas mod_python provides its
own specific APIs and thus a web application written direct for that
isn't portable to any other hosting option, in mod_wsgi the Python
WSGI standard is used. An application written to the Python WSGI
standard is portable to any of the options listed here. There are even
workable, although not perfect, WSGI adapters for mod_python.

3. Python web application runs within a daemon process separate to the
web server and requests are proxied from the web server to this daemon
process. The web server is written in C. Rather than HTTP protocol
being used as in option 1 above, an alternate protocol is used. There
are actually a number of different variations on this theme.

3a. In the case of the mod_wsgi module, it supports a daemon mode in
addition to embedded mode. It uses it own internal protocol for
proxying data. This is done as mod_wsgi daemon processes are a direct
fork of the Apache child processes and so they are tightly coupled.

3b. Next are solutions based on FASTGCI protocol for proxying of
request to daemon process. The daemon process can either be started
separately, or be forked from Apache, but then a distinct application
executed. The application run in this case would actually be the
Python executable. A module such as flup would be used which
understands the FASTCGI protocol thereby allowing communication with
the web server. Web applications may be written direct to flup
interface to FASTCGI protocol, or written to WSGI standard and a
flup/WSGI adapter used.

3c. Like 3b, but SCGI protocol used instead. The flup package would
still be used as it also supports SCGI.

3d. Like 3b, but AJP protocol used instead. The flup package would
still be used as it also supports AJP.

Although 3a, and I think 3c and 3d are specific to Apache, the FASTCGI
protocol described is also supported by lighttpd and nginx.

If you want the most portable option for writing a Python web
application, write it to the WSGI standard or use an existing
framework which supports that standard. That way you can use any of
the above options.

Hope this answers your question.
